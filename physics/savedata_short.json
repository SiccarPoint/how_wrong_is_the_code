Inspired by a few awesome projects including:\n\n- [Sporel] - An awesome demo by @mrdoob\n- [ThreeJS GPGPU Examples] - A great example of flocking by @BlurSpline\n- [Soulwire's GPGPU Particles] - Prettiness by the one and only @soulwire\n\nUsing this tool ( or previous, uglier versions of it ) I've made a whole smorgasbord of projects, including, but most definitely not limited to:\n\n- [Needs]\n- [Flow]\n- [NVS]\n- [We Over]\n- [Bees]\n- [DRAGONFISH]\n- [Huldra]\n- [Diamonds]\n\nBecause GPGPU Calculations are not something many developers are familiar with, I'd like to talk a bit about them, including pros / cons , limitations, etc, but if you want to skip straight to the good stuff ( AKA Code ), feel free to dive into the following examples. This definitely is a subject that staring at code really helps with:\n\n- [Curl Noise]\n- [Collisions]\n- [Gravity]\n- [Flocking]\n\nAlso, at any point in time, jump straight over to the [Github] for the code! With all of this being said, lets start talking about how to use the Physics Renderer! If you want to know a bit more about how it actually works, check out the BACKGROUND section, but hopefully it is easy enough that you shouldn't *have* to know how crazy the gpgpu really gets!\n\n\n###Caveats\n\nFirst things first, The PhysicsRenderer requires the use of Floating Point Textures. This is not something that is available ( *YET* ) in phones, so if you are trying to make a mobile friendly site, please run while you still can!\n\nSecond, GPU performance varies dramatically from computer to computer, so make sure you have multiple machines, or multiple friends with multiple machines, to test on!\n\nThird, This specific renderer uses 2 positions textures to get a velocity, and interpolates based on that. Its much more efficient than having a seperate pass for position and velocity, but makes other parts more difficult, such as collisions. I have plans to add different types of render pases into this ( 3 old positions , pos / vel , etc ), but have not done so yet! If you have any good ideas of how to do this, let me know on [TWITTER]\n\nFourth, for most of these examples, I will be using another Utility that I have written: [ShaderLoader] , because its a cool tool, and I'm too lazy to make things from scratch, but rest assured that ANY shader you write can still be used in this tool!\n\n\n\n#Usage\n\n##Boring Setup Stuff:\n\n###Including Scripts\n\nAs usual, the first thing you need to do is include the script\n```javascript\n    <script src=\"PATH/TO/PhysicsRenderer.js\"></script>\n```\n\n###Initializing the PhysicsRenderer\n\nWithin the 'Initialization' phase of your application, create the renderer. To do this you will need 3 pieces of information:\n\n- Size of Simulation ( actual size is this number squared )\n- The Simulation Shader\n- WebGL Renderer\n\n##### Size\nThe size that will be passed into the PhysicsRenderer is not actually the number of particles, but rather the width / height of the texture to be used. This means that the actual number of positions in the simulation will be Size * Size . Also, for the sake of older GPUs  please try and keep this number a Power of 2 , AKA: 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 ( that corresponds to 1048576 different position calculations BTW.... )\n\n##### Simulation Shader\nThis is the soul of the physics renderer. You can think of it as the 'Kernel' that you are passing into to the GPU to be run. I will go into more depth about what this is later, but for now, just remember that is is a Fragment Shader passed in as a text string.\n\n##### WebGL Renderer\nThis will just be the Three.js Renderer you use for everything else, so nothing fancy hear, just make sure you declare it before you create the PhysicsRenderer.\n\nPutting all these together the intialization looks a lil something like this:\n\n```javascript\n    var size = 128;\n    var simulationShader = \"SIMULATION FRAGMENT SHADER\"\n    renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n    \n    physicsRenderer = new PhysicsRenderer( size , simulationShader , renderer );\n```\n\n###Updating the Renderer\nOnce its been initialized, all we have to do to use the renderer is update it in our animation loop, like so\n```javascript\n    physicsRenderer.update();\n```\n\nIf you do only these things, nothing is going to happen, and infact, you may get some errors, so lets dig a bit further and talk about what the simulation shader is going to look like:\n\n##Simulation Shader:\nThe simulation shader is the most important part of this tool, and everything else about the tool is just trying to get it to run. It will be written in GLSL, so we'll break it down by sections of the glsl program\n\n### Uniforms\n\nThe first thing we will have to do is include the proper uniforms. In our case there are 3 that are mandatory: The Current Position Texture , The Old Positition Texture, and the resolution of simulation. Declaring them looks like so:\n\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos;  // Current Position Texture\nuniform sampler2D t_oPos; // Old Position Texture\nuniform vec2 resolution;  // Resolution of simulation\n```\n\n*ALWAYS PUT THESE IN YOUR PROGRAM!!!*\n\n### Main \n\nWithin the 'main' function, we use these uniforms to do our proper physics! To do this, we first need to get a 'UV' position that will tell us where to look up in the texture to get our position, than we will use this uv to get our positions, got through the process of applying forces, and than at the very end, color the pixel accordingly \n\n##### UV\n\nThe resolution uniform is vital for this set , because it gives us exactly where in the texture our current position lies. We get this uv by doing the following:\n\n```glsl\nvec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;\n```\n\n##### Positions\nnext we use our uv to look up the correct positions\n\n```glsl\n  vec4 oPos = texture2D( t_oPos , uv );\n  vec4 pos  = texture2D( t_pos  , uv );\n```\n\n#####Velocity\nWe can determine velocity from these two positions:\n```glsl\nvec3 vel = pos.xyz - oPos.xyz;\n```\n\n#####Force\nThis is the section of the program which can be all you! For now, I'll show you the most basic example: Fake Gravity.\n\n```glsl\nvec3 force = vec3( 0. , -1. , 0. );\n```\n\n#####Getting New Position\nUsing position, velocity and force, we can than get a new position, like so:\n```glsl\nvel += force;\nvec3 newPos = pos.xyz + vel;\n```\n\n#####Assigning New Position\nNow that we've got a new position, all we have to do is assign it:\n```glsl\ngl_FragColor = vec4( newPos , 1. );\n```\n\n#####Putting it all together:\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos; \nuniform sampler2D t_oPos; \nuniform vec2 resolution; \n\nvoid main(){\n\n    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;\n    \n    vec4 oPos = texture2D( t_oPos , uv );\n    vec4 pos  = texture2D( t_pos  , uv );\n    \n    vec3 vel = pos.xyz - oPos.xyz;\n    \n    vec3 force = vec3( 0. , -1. , 0. );\n\n    vel += force;\n    vec3 newPos = pos.xyz + vel;\n    \n    gl_FragColor = vec4( newPos , 1. );\n    \n}\n```\n\n#####Going Further\nThe above is just about the MOST basic example possible, but theres so many other fun things you can do! Add dampenign to the velocity, make it so particles respawn somewhere else, etc. etc. etc. Check out the examples to see all the weird ways you can make points move!!!\n\n\n##Using the Output\nNow that we've discussed how to create the PhysicsRenderer, and pass in a simulation shader that will do a bunch of awesome calculations for us, We need to know how to use it. This will require a few things: Creating a geometry that knows how to use the output textures, creating a Material that knows how to use the output textures, and binding the output texture. \n\n##### Creating a Geometry\nJust like in the simulation shader, where we created a uv by using the gl_FragCoord, we will make a geometry where the position corresponds to a position in a texture, rather than an actual position in 3D Space. We do this like so:\n\n```javascript\nfunction createLookupGeometry( size ){        \n        \n    var geo = new THREE.BufferGeometry();\n    var positions = new Float32Array(  size * size * 3 );\n\n    for ( var i = 0, j = 0, l = positions.length / 3; i < l; i ++, j += 3 ) {\n\n        positions[ j     ] = ( i % size ) / size;\n        positions[ j + 1 ] = Math.floor( i / size ) / size;\n    \n    }\n\n    var posA = new THREE.BufferAttribute( positions , 3 );\n    geo.addAttribute( 'position', posA );\n\n    return geo;\n    \n}\n```\n\nRight now, this is wasting the z data of the position, but consider that another constraint to play with!\n\n##### Creating a Material\nNext We have to create a material that can use all of our data and create something meaningful on the screen. For right now, I will create the simplest possible material, but rest assured that some [REALLY WEIRD MATERIALS] can be made... \n\nLets break the material down into its seperate parts: The Uniforms, The Vertex Shader, and The Fragment Shader\n\n######Uniforms\nThe Uniforms will be like any other set of shader uniforms, with One mandatory addition, the positions texture that will come from the simulation shader. Because of this, the most basic uniforms will look like this:\n```javascript\nvar uniforms =  { \n    t_pos: { type:\"t\" , value: null }\n}\n```\n\n######Vertex Shader\nThe vertex shader will do nothing but use the position of the geometry to look up into the positions texture, and than place the particle based on this information:\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos;\n\nvoid main(){\n\n  vec4 pos = texture2D( t_pos , position.xy );\n  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( pos.xyz , 1. );\n  \n}\n```\n\n######Fragment Shader\nThe fragment shader than will look like any other fragment shader. All of the magic has already been done in the vertex shader:\n```glsl\nvoid main(){\n  gl_FragColor = vec4( 1. );\n}\n```\n\n##### Bringing it into THREE\nWe than bring all of this information into THREE by doing the following:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar geometry = createLookupGeometry( size );\nvar material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({\n    uniforms:uniforms,\n    vertexShader:vertexShader,\n    fragmentShader:fragmentShader\n});\n\nvar particles = new THREE.PointCloud( geometry, material );\nparticles.frustumCulled = false;\n\nscene.add( particles );\n\n```\nNotice the line:\n```javscript\nparticles.frustumCulled = false;\n```\nThis is because all the particles will ahve positions that are not their true positions, so three.js may cull them, even though they should still be visible\n\n##### Binding the texture\nThe last thing we need to do is bind the output of the PhysicsRenderer, so that it is used by our particle system. Luckily this is only a single line, and the PhysicsRenderer takes care of the rest:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.addBoundTexture( uniforms.t_pos , 'output' );\n```\n\ndoing this will make sure that whenever physicsRenderer.update is called, it will make sure that its output is assigned to the value of the uniform that is passed in!\n\n## Other Helpful Functions\n\nAlthough the above is all you need to get rolling, there are some very helpful functions to give you additional functionality\n\n#### Assigning Uniforms\n\nDigging all the way into the Physics Renderer to set a uniform is pretty annoying,  so here are some other ways to set uniforms\n\n###### Setting a single uniform\nSet a single uniform with whatever name you want!\n```javascript\nvar uniforms ={\n    time:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n    dT:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n}\n\nphysicsRenderer.setUniform( 'nameInSimulationShader' , uniforms.dT );\n```\n\n###### Setting Multiple Uniforms\nSet all uniforms from another set of unifoms\n```javascript\nvar uniforms ={\n    time:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n    dT:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n}\n\nphysicsRenderer.setUniforms( uniforms );\n```\nKeep in mind, that because the PhysicsRenderer always needs t_pos , t_oPos , and resolution, even if you try to set these via this method, the PhysicsRenderer will override them!\n\n####Reseting Positions\nYou may want to place the particles at a certain place to start, because they will currently start all at [0,0,0]. This makes pretty much every simulation kindof boring, because you will only see 1 point... Because of this there are multiply ways to set positions:\n\n######Reseting position randomly\nThe easiest way to get a quick feel for a simulation is to reset the positions randomly. This is done with a 1-liner\n```javascript\n// Resets positions in a random box of side length 5\nphysicsRenderer.resetRand( 5 );\n```\n\n######Reseting Positions with another texture\nYou can also create a specific texture with position information and reset it this way. Altough the creation of the texture might be a bit more than one line, the call to reset using a texture is only:\n```javascript\nvar texture = createPositionTexture(size);\nphysicsRenderer.reset( texture );\n```\nJust for the sake of completeness, here's a sample 'createPositionTexture' function:\n```javascript\nfunction createPositionTexture(size){\n\n  var data = new Float32Array( size * size * 4 );\n\n  for( var i =0; i < data.length; i++ ){\n\n    //makes some weird sin based positions\n    data[ i ] = Math.sin( i*.1 ) * 30;\n    \n  }\n\n  var texture = new THREE.DataTexture( \n    data,\n    this.size,\n    this.size,\n    THREE.RGBAFormat,\n    THREE.FloatType\n  );\n\n  texture.minFilter =  THREE.NearestFilter,\n  texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter,\n\n  texture.needsUpdate = true;\n\n  return texture;\n\n\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Adding a debugScene\nSometimes things might not be going right, and you want to see the actual data textures, or things are going right, and you want to see the data textures. They can look [REALLY COOL]. To do this, just call:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.addDebugScene( scene );\n```\nYou can change the scale of this scene ( and probably will have to  ), my playing with the THREE.Object3D which is physicsRenderer.debugScene. like so:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.debugScene.scale.multiplyScalar( .1 );\n```\n\n## YOU MADE IT DOWN HERE!\nThats alot of reading you've just done. Why don't you go play with some examples now, or let me know on [TWITTER] why everything I've said is wrong! If you want to keep learnign about the GPU, keep reading on for a bit of background!\n\n#Background\n\n### What are GPGPU Calculations ?!??!\n\nThe first thing you need to understand about the physics renderer is how it actually works! Well you don't actually, but its reallly reallly cool, so stay with me!\n\nYour screen has alot of pixels right? And for a graphics programs, each one of these pixels needs to be told what color it should be. That is a WHOLE bunch of pixels. More than 5 million on my computer, and maybe even more on yours!\n\nYour GPU is in charge of doing all the calculations that tell you what color to make these pixels, and it is EXTREMELY good at doing so. It does this a bunch of different threads, and doing all the calculations in parrallel. This is a dramatic simplification. If you really want to nerd out, check out this article on [GPU Architecture].\n\nNow, although things like [WebCL] are coming to the browser at some point in time, and there is actually a [WebCL Extension for Firefox], General Purpose ( meaning anything not vertex / fragment shader based ) calculations done on the GPU can be a bit of a beast to work with. But WHY ?!?!?\n\n### Tricking Your Computer\n\nTo do GPGPU ( General Purpose GPU ) calculations in WebGl, we have to use only the tools given to us. In the case of WebGL, thats vertex and fragment shaders. However, the output of these is a vec4 that represents a color. In WebGL, the GPU reallly likes doing colors, but everything else is a bit of a stretch. \n\nAll this means though, is that we let the computer do colors, but use them for different purposes! By simply pretending that Red, Green and Blue values are actually X , Y and Z values, we get to tell the computer we are coloring pixels, when we are actually doing physics!!! ( insert evil laughter here!!! )\n\n\n\n[Github]:http://github.com/cabbibo/PhysicsRenderer/\n\n[Sporel]:http://mrdoob.com/#/153/sporel\n[ThreeJS GPGPU Examples]:

"readme_text": "# PhysicsRenderer \n- Check it out on  [Github] !!!!!\n- Contact me via [TWITTER]!!!!!\n\n### Introduction\n\nAn awesome lil helper to help you do gpgpu calculations! Inspired by a few awesome projects including:\n\n- [Sporel] - An awesome demo by @mrdoob\n- [ThreeJS GPGPU Examples] - A great example of flocking by @BlurSpline\n- [Soulwire's GPGPU Particles] - Prettiness by the one and only @soulwire\n\nUsing this tool ( or previous, uglier versions of it ) I've made a whole smorgasbord of projects, including, but most definitely not limited to:\n\n- [Needs]\n- [Flow]\n- [NVS]\n- [We Over]\n- [Bees]\n- [DRAGONFISH]\n- [Huldra]\n- [Diamonds]\n\nBecause GPGPU Calculations are not something many developers are familiar with, I'd like to talk a bit about them, including pros / cons , limitations, etc, but if you want to skip straight to the good stuff ( AKA Code ), feel free to dive into the following examples. This definitely is a subject that staring at code really helps with:\n\n- [Curl Noise]\n- [Collisions]\n- [Gravity]\n- [Flocking]\n\nAlso, at any point in time, jump straight over to the [Github] for the code! With all of this being said, lets start talking about how to use the Physics Renderer! If you want to know a bit more about how it actually works, check out the BACKGROUND section, but hopefully it is easy enough that you shouldn't *have* to know how crazy the gpgpu really gets!\n\n\n###Caveats\n\nFirst things first, The PhysicsRenderer requires the use of Floating Point Textures. This is not something that is available ( *YET* ) in phones, so if you are trying to make a mobile friendly site, please run while you still can!\n\nSecond, GPU performance varies dramatically from computer to computer, so make sure you have multiple machines, or multiple friends with multiple machines, to test on!\n\nThird, This specific renderer uses 2 positions textures to get a velocity, and interpolates based on that. Its much more efficient than having a seperate pass for position and velocity, but makes other parts more difficult, such as collisions. I have plans to add different types of render pases into this ( 3 old positions , pos / vel , etc ), but have not done so yet! If you have any good ideas of how to do this, let me know on [TWITTER]\n\nFourth, for most of these examples, I will be using another Utility that I have written: [ShaderLoader] , because its a cool tool, and I'm too lazy to make things from scratch, but rest assured that ANY shader you write can still be used in this tool!\n\n\n\n#Usage\n\n##Boring Setup Stuff:\n\n###Including Scripts\n\nAs usual, the first thing you need to do is include the script\n```javascript\n    <script src=\"PATH/TO/PhysicsRenderer.js\"></script>\n```\n\n###Initializing the PhysicsRenderer\n\nWithin the 'Initialization' phase of your application, create the renderer. To do this you will need 3 pieces of information:\n\n- Size of Simulation ( actual size is this number squared )\n- The Simulation Shader\n- WebGL Renderer\n\n##### Size\nThe size that will be passed into the PhysicsRenderer is not actually the number of particles, but rather the width / height of the texture to be used. This means that the actual number of positions in the simulation will be Size * Size . Also, for the sake of older GPUs  please try and keep this number a Power of 2 , AKA: 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 ( that corresponds to 1048576 different position calculations BTW.... )\n\n##### Simulation Shader\nThis is the soul of the physics renderer. You can think of it as the 'Kernel' that you are passing into to the GPU to be run. I will go into more depth about what this is later, but for now, just remember that is is a Fragment Shader passed in as a text string.\n\n##### WebGL Renderer\nThis will just be the Three.js Renderer you use for everything else, so nothing fancy hear, just make sure you declare it before you create the PhysicsRenderer.\n\nPutting all these together the intialization looks a lil something like this:\n\n```javascript\n    var size = 128;\n    var simulationShader = \"SIMULATION FRAGMENT SHADER\"\n    renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n    \n    physicsRenderer = new PhysicsRenderer( size , simulationShader , renderer );\n```\n\n###Updating the Renderer\nOnce its been initialized, all we have to do to use the renderer is update it in our animation loop, like so\n```javascript\n    physicsRenderer.update();\n```\n\nIf you do only these things, nothing is going to happen, and infact, you may get some errors, so lets dig a bit further and talk about what the simulation shader is going to look like:\n\n##Simulation Shader:\nThe simulation shader is the most important part of this tool, and everything else about the tool is just trying to get it to run. It will be written in GLSL, so we'll break it down by sections of the glsl program\n\n### Uniforms\n\nThe first thing we will have to do is include the proper uniforms. In our case there are 3 that are mandatory: The Current Position Texture , The Old Positition Texture, and the resolution of simulation. Declaring them looks like so:\n\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos;  // Current Position Texture\nuniform sampler2D t_oPos; // Old Position Texture\nuniform vec2 resolution;  // Resolution of simulation\n```\n\n*ALWAYS PUT THESE IN YOUR PROGRAM!!!*\n\n### Main \n\nWithin the 'main' function, we use these uniforms to do our proper physics! To do this, we first need to get a 'UV' position that will tell us where to look up in the texture to get our position, than we will use this uv to get our positions, got through the process of applying forces, and than at the very end, color the pixel accordingly \n\n##### UV\n\nThe resolution uniform is vital for this set , because it gives us exactly where in the texture our current position lies. We get this uv by doing the following:\n\n```glsl\nvec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;\n```\n\n##### Positions\nnext we use our uv to look up the correct positions\n\n```glsl\n  vec4 oPos = texture2D( t_oPos , uv );\n  vec4 pos  = texture2D( t_pos  , uv );\n```\n\n#####Velocity\nWe can determine velocity from these two positions:\n```glsl\nvec3 vel = pos.xyz - oPos.xyz;\n```\n\n#####Force\nThis is the section of the program which can be all you! For now, I'll show you the most basic example: Fake Gravity.\n\n```glsl\nvec3 force = vec3( 0. , -1. , 0. );\n```\n\n#####Getting New Position\nUsing position, velocity and force, we can than get a new position, like so:\n```glsl\nvel += force;\nvec3 newPos = pos.xyz + vel;\n```\n\n#####Assigning New Position\nNow that we've got a new position, all we have to do is assign it:\n```glsl\ngl_FragColor = vec4( newPos , 1. );\n```\n\n#####Putting it all together:\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos; \nuniform sampler2D t_oPos; \nuniform vec2 resolution; \n\nvoid main(){\n\n    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution;\n    \n    vec4 oPos = texture2D( t_oPos , uv );\n    vec4 pos  = texture2D( t_pos  , uv );\n    \n    vec3 vel = pos.xyz - oPos.xyz;\n    \n    vec3 force = vec3( 0. , -1. , 0. );\n\n    vel += force;\n    vec3 newPos = pos.xyz + vel;\n    \n    gl_FragColor = vec4( newPos , 1. );\n    \n}\n```\n\n#####Going Further\nThe above is just about the MOST basic example possible, but theres so many other fun things you can do! Add dampenign to the velocity, make it so particles respawn somewhere else, etc. etc. etc. Check out the examples to see all the weird ways you can make points move!!!\n\n\n##Using the Output\nNow that we've discussed how to create the PhysicsRenderer, and pass in a simulation shader that will do a bunch of awesome calculations for us, We need to know how to use it. This will require a few things: Creating a geometry that knows how to use the output textures, creating a Material that knows how to use the output textures, and binding the output texture. \n\n##### Creating a Geometry\nJust like in the simulation shader, where we created a uv by using the gl_FragCoord, we will make a geometry where the position corresponds to a position in a texture, rather than an actual position in 3D Space. We do this like so:\n\n```javascript\nfunction createLookupGeometry( size ){        \n        \n    var geo = new THREE.BufferGeometry();\n    var positions = new Float32Array(  size * size * 3 );\n\n    for ( var i = 0, j = 0, l = positions.length / 3; i < l; i ++, j += 3 ) {\n\n        positions[ j     ] = ( i % size ) / size;\n        positions[ j + 1 ] = Math.floor( i / size ) / size;\n    \n    }\n\n    var posA = new THREE.BufferAttribute( positions , 3 );\n    geo.addAttribute( 'position', posA );\n\n    return geo;\n    \n}\n```\n\nRight now, this is wasting the z data of the position, but consider that another constraint to play with!\n\n##### Creating a Material\nNext We have to create a material that can use all of our data and create something meaningful on the screen. For right now, I will create the simplest possible material, but rest assured that some [REALLY WEIRD MATERIALS] can be made... \n\nLets break the material down into its seperate parts: The Uniforms, The Vertex Shader, and The Fragment Shader\n\n######Uniforms\nThe Uniforms will be like any other set of shader uniforms, with One mandatory addition, the positions texture that will come from the simulation shader. Because of this, the most basic uniforms will look like this:\n```javascript\nvar uniforms =  { \n    t_pos: { type:\"t\" , value: null }\n}\n```\n\n######Vertex Shader\nThe vertex shader will do nothing but use the position of the geometry to look up into the positions texture, and than place the particle based on this information:\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D t_pos;\n\nvoid main(){\n\n  vec4 pos = texture2D( t_pos , position.xy );\n  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( pos.xyz , 1. );\n  \n}\n```\n\n######Fragment Shader\nThe fragment shader than will look like any other fragment shader. All of the magic has already been done in the vertex shader:\n```glsl\nvoid main(){\n  gl_FragColor = vec4( 1. );\n}\n```\n\n##### Bringing it into THREE\nWe than bring all of this information into THREE by doing the following:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar geometry = createLookupGeometry( size );\nvar material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({\n    uniforms:uniforms,\n    vertexShader:vertexShader,\n    fragmentShader:fragmentShader\n});\n\nvar particles = new THREE.PointCloud( geometry, material );\nparticles.frustumCulled = false;\n\nscene.add( particles );\n\n```\nNotice the line:\n```javscript\nparticles.frustumCulled = false;\n```\nThis is because all the particles will ahve positions that are not their true positions, so three.js may cull them, even though they should still be visible\n\n##### Binding the texture\nThe last thing we need to do is bind the output of the PhysicsRenderer, so that it is used by our particle system. Luckily this is only a single line, and the PhysicsRenderer takes care of the rest:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.addBoundTexture( uniforms.t_pos , 'output' );\n```\n\ndoing this will make sure that whenever physicsRenderer.update is called, it will make sure that its output is assigned to the value of the uniform that is passed in!\n\n## Other Helpful Functions\n\nAlthough the above is all you need to get rolling, there are some very helpful functions to give you additional functionality\n\n#### Assigning Uniforms\n\nDigging all the way into the Physics Renderer to set a uniform is pretty annoying,  so here are some other ways to set uniforms\n\n###### Setting a single uniform\nSet a single uniform with whatever name you want!\n```javascript\nvar uniforms ={\n    time:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n    dT:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n}\n\nphysicsRenderer.setUniform( 'nameInSimulationShader' , uniforms.dT );\n```\n\n###### Setting Multiple Uniforms\nSet all uniforms from another set of unifoms\n```javascript\nvar uniforms ={\n    time:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n    dT:{ type:\"f\" , value:0 },\n}\n\nphysicsRenderer.setUniforms( uniforms );\n```\nKeep in mind, that because the PhysicsRenderer always needs t_pos , t_oPos , and resolution, even if you try to set these via this method, the PhysicsRenderer will override them!\n\n####Reseting Positions\nYou may want to place the particles at a certain place to start, because they will currently start all at [0,0,0]. This makes pretty much every simulation kindof boring, because you will only see 1 point... Because of this there are multiply ways to set positions:\n\n######Reseting position randomly\nThe easiest way to get a quick feel for a simulation is to reset the positions randomly. This is done with a 1-liner\n```javascript\n// Resets positions in a random box of side length 5\nphysicsRenderer.resetRand( 5 );\n```\n\n######Reseting Positions with another texture\nYou can also create a specific texture with position information and reset it this way. Altough the creation of the texture might be a bit more than one line, the call to reset using a texture is only:\n```javascript\nvar texture = createPositionTexture(size);\nphysicsRenderer.reset( texture );\n```\nJust for the sake of completeness, here's a sample 'createPositionTexture' function:\n```javascript\nfunction createPositionTexture(size){\n\n  var data = new Float32Array( size * size * 4 );\n\n  for( var i =0; i < data.length; i++ ){\n\n    //makes some weird sin based positions\n    data[ i ] = Math.sin( i*.1 ) * 30;\n    \n  }\n\n  var texture = new THREE.DataTexture( \n    data,\n    this.size,\n    this.size,\n    THREE.RGBAFormat,\n    THREE.FloatType\n  );\n\n  texture.minFilter =  THREE.NearestFilter,\n  texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter,\n\n  texture.needsUpdate = true;\n\n  return texture;\n\n\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Adding a debugScene\nSometimes things might not be going right, and you want to see the actual data textures, or things are going right, and you want to see the data textures. They can look [REALLY COOL]. To do this, just call:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.addDebugScene( scene );\n```\nYou can change the scale of this scene ( and probably will have to  ), my playing with the THREE.Object3D which is physicsRenderer.debugScene. like so:\n```javascript\nphysicsRenderer.debugScene.scale.multiplyScalar( .1 );\n```\n\n## YOU MADE IT DOWN HERE!\nThats alot of reading you've just done. Why don't you go play with some examples now, or let me know on [TWITTER] why everything I've said is wrong! If you want to keep learnign about the GPU, keep reading on for a bit of background!\n\n#Background\n\n### What are GPGPU Calculations ?!??!\n\nThe first thing you need to understand about the physics renderer is how it actually works! Well you don't actually, but its reallly reallly cool, so stay with me!\n\nYour screen has alot of pixels right? And for a graphics programs, each one of these pixels needs to be told what color it should be. That is a WHOLE bunch of pixels. More than 5 million on my computer, and maybe even more on yours!\n\nYour GPU is in charge of doing all the calculations that tell you what color to make these pixels, and it is EXTREMELY good at doing so. It does this a bunch of different threads, and doing all the calculations in parrallel. This is a dramatic simplification. If you really want to nerd out, check out this article on [GPU Architecture].\n\nNow, although things like [WebCL] are coming to the browser at some point in time, and there is actually a [WebCL Extension for Firefox], General Purpose ( meaning anything not vertex / fragment shader based ) calculations done on the GPU can be a bit of a beast to work with. But WHY ?!?!?\n\n### Tricking Your Computer\n\nTo do GPGPU ( General Purpose GPU ) calculations in WebGl, we have to use only the tools given to us. In the case of WebGL, thats vertex and fragment shaders. However, the output of these is a vec4 that represents a color. In WebGL, the GPU reallly likes doing colors, but everything else is a bit of a stretch. \n\nAll this means though, is that we let the computer do colors, but use them for different purposes! By simply pretending that Red, Green and Blue values are actually X , Y and Z values, we get to tell the computer we are coloring pixels, when we are actually doing physics!!!

Alternatively, the animation can be created using `+animation` and by setting the key path afterwards. The full list of currently-compatible animatable properties is available in the header.\n\n```objc\nJNWSpringAnimation *animation = [JNWSpringAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@\"position.x\"];\n```\n\nNext, the `fromValue` and `toValue` properties must be set for the interpolated values to be calculated correctly.\n\n```objc\nanimation.toValue = @(toX);\nanimation.fromValue = @(currentX);\n```\n\nFinally, the values for the spring constants can optionally be changed. Currently, `stiffness`, `damping`, and `mass` are available for modification.\n\n```objc\nanimation.mass = 30; // this will move extremely slowly\n// and so on\n```\n\nThe animation itself can be applied like any other subclass of `CAAnimation`, namely `-addAnimation:forKey:` on any `CALayer`.\n\n## What's this for? ##\n\nThis was created in my desire to have an open-source version of the (currently private) `CASpringAnimation` which was discovered in iOS 6.\n\nSpring animations, when used appropriately, can really enhance the way your app feels to the user by connecting in physical simulations with an app's interface. And besides, who doesn't love messing around with springs?\n\n## What's left to do? ##\n\nI created this as a weekend project, so the implementation is still somewhat unfinished. Compared to `CASpringAnimation`, the `velocity` property is still unimplemented. Pull requests are welcome.\n\n## License ##\n`JNWSpringAnimation` is licensed under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n## Get In Touch ##\nYou can follow me on Twitter as [@willing](http://twitter.com/willing), email me at the email listed on my GitHub profile, or read my blog at [jwilling.com](http://www.jwilling.com).\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 45, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "97e888cff6935e66fe105bf00258de3172b82584 24"},

animations.\n\n![](http://jwilling.com/serve/github/jnwspringanimation/preview.gif)\n\n## Getting Started ##\nAlthough `JNWSpringAnimation` is a subclass of `CAKeyframeAnimation`, it should be treated as if it were a subclass of `CABasicAnimation`. \n\nTo get started, copy the four source files into your project.\n\nThe animation can be created by using the dedicated initializer, `+animationWithKeyPath:`. Alternatively, the animation can be created using `+animation` and by setting the key path afterwards. The full list of currently-compatible animatable properties is available in the header.\n\n```objc\nJNWSpringAnimation *animation = [JNWSpringAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@\"position.x\"];\n```\n\nNext, the `fromValue` and `toValue` properties must be set for the interpolated values to be calculated correctly.\n\n```objc\nanimation.toValue = @(toX);\nanimation.fromValue = @(currentX);\n```\n\nFinally, the values for the spring constants can optionally be changed. Currently, `stiffness`, `damping`, and `mass` are available for modification.\n\n```objc\nanimation.mass = 30; // this will move extremely slowly\n// and so on\n```\n\nThe animation itself can be applied like any other subclass of `CAAnimation`, namely `-addAnimation:forKey:` on any `CALayer`.\n\n## What's this for? ##\n\nThis was created in my desire to have an open-source version of the (currently private) `CASpringAnimation` which was discovered in iOS 6.\n\nSpring animations, when used appropriately, can really enhance the way your app feels to the user by connecting in physical simulations with an app's interface. And besides, who doesn't love messing around with springs?\n\n## What's left to do? ##\n\nI created this as a weekend project, so the implementation is still somewhat unfinished. Compared to `CASpringAnimation`, the `velocity` property is still unimplemented. Pull requests are welcome.\n\n## License ##\n`JNWSpringAnimation` is licensed under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n## Get In Touch ##\nYou can follow me on Twitter as [@willing](http://twitter.com/willing), email me at the email listed on my GitHub profile, or read my blog at [jwilling.com](http://www.jwilling.com).\n"}, "leeyt/Physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "leeyt/Physics", "diskUsage": 19010, "name": "Physics", "owner": {"login": "leeyt"}, "languages": {"nodes": []}, "createdAt": "2013-04-13T07:49:12Z", "pushedAt": "2015-06-12T09:44:31Z", "object": {"text": "Physics is a very fascinating subject. \n\nProf. Walter Lewin, the renowned professor emeritus at MIT, will make you love physics, and see the world in a different way.\n\nAs I watch his lecture videos on iTunes U, I would like to take down some notes so I won't forget easily and it won't be a waste of time. \n\nPlease visit [MIT OpenCourseWare][1] to search for these three courses complete with homeworks, exams, etc.\n\n# Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999\n\nWalter Lewin, 8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999.<br>\n(Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare).<br>\n[http://ocw.mit.edu][1] (accessed 04 08, 2013).<br>\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike.\n\n# Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism, Spring 2002\n\nWalter Lewin, 8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism, Spring 2002.<br>\n(Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare).<br>\n[http://ocw.mit.edu][1] (accessed 04 08, 2013).<br>\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike.\n\n# Physics III: Vibrations and Waves, Fall 2004\n\nWalter Lewin, 8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves, Fall 2004.<br>\n(Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare).<br>\n[http://ocw.mit.edu][1] (accessed 04 08, 2013).<br>\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike.\n\n[1]: http://ocw.mit.edu \"MIT OpenCourseWare\"\n[2]: http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/ \"iTunes U\""}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 32, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "e33aa87cd6f9fee00272fbfce7321f4bd5a55f00 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 18226, "author": {"name": "neillee"}, "pushedDate": "2015-06-12T09:44:31Z", "messageHeadline": "Update", "message": "Update"}}, {"node": {"additions": 625, "author": {"name": "neillee"}, "pushedDate": "2013-11-27T11:19:14Z", "messageHeadline": "26.

_\"Physics-Based Deep Learning\"_\n(PBDL), i.e. the field of methods with combinations of physical modeling and\ndeep learning (DL) techniques. Here, DL will typically refer to methods based\non artificial neural networks. The general direction of PBDL represents a very\nactive and quickly growing field of research. \n\n![An overview of categories of physics-based deep learning methods](resources/physics-based-deep-learning-overview.jpg)\n\nWithin this area we can roughly distinguish the following five categories:\n\n- _Physics-based design_: incorporate domain knowledge about the\n  system in the architecture of the learning process, e.g.,\n  adapt the connectivity of a neural network such that it facilitates \n  certain solutions.\n\n- _Physics-based constraints_: guide and constrain the learning\n  process with physical models, e.g., in the simplest case\n  by including additional terms in the loss function.\n\n- _Combined methods_: hybrid solvers that employ traditional\n  numerical methods alongside deep-learning techniques to arrive\n  at simulations methods that are improved in terms of, e.g., \n  efficiency, accuracy, generalization etc.\n\n- _Outer-loop optimizations_:\n  approaches that aim for higher level control or inverse\n  problems, typically with an outer loop around a simulation.\n  Here, fast and differentiable models exhibit particular promise.\n\n- _Applications_: there are also many methods that apply established DL\n  techniques to physical problems without really changing them. These\n  works are nonetheless often highly interesting and much needed\n  to establish methodologies of how DL can be best used for physical\n  problems.\n\nIn practice, these categories only serve as a rough guide to the space of\nmethods in the area of physics-based deep learning, and there are many works\nbelow that combine aspects from more than one of these classes.\n\nThis repository collects links to works on _deep learning algorithms for physics\nproblems_, with a particular emphasis on _fluid flow_, i.e., Navier-Stokes related\nproblems. It especially collects links to the works of the I15 lab at TUM, as\nwell as miscellaneous works from other groups. This is by no means a complete\nlist, so let us know if you come across additional papers in this area. We\nintentionally also focus on works from the _deep learning_ field, not machine\nlearning in general.\n\n![An example flow result from

Learning\"_\n(PBDL), i.e. the field of methods with combinations of physical modeling and\ndeep learning (DL) techniques. Here, DL will typically refer to methods based\non artificial neural networks. The general direction of PBDL represents a very\nactive and quickly growing field of research. \n\n![An overview of categories of physics-based deep learning methods](resources/physics-based-deep-learning-overview.jpg)\n\nWithin this area we can roughly distinguish the following five categories:\n\n- _Physics-based design_: incorporate domain knowledge about the\n  system in the architecture of the learning process, e.g.,\n  adapt the connectivity of a neural network such that it facilitates \n  certain solutions.\n\n- _Physics-based constraints_: guide and constrain the learning\n  process with physical models, e.g., in the simplest case\n  by including additional terms in the loss function.\n\n- _Combined methods_: hybrid solvers that employ traditional\n  numerical methods alongside deep-learning techniques to arrive\n  at simulations methods that are improved in terms of, e.g., \n  efficiency, accuracy, generalization etc.\n\n- _Outer-loop optimizations_:\n  approaches that aim for higher level control or inverse\n  problems, typically with an outer loop around a simulation.\n  Here, fast and differentiable models exhibit particular promise.\n\n- _Applications_: there are also many methods that apply established DL\n  techniques to physical problems without really changing them. These\n  works are nonetheless often highly interesting and much needed\n  to establish methodologies of how DL can be best used for physical\n  problems.\n\nIn practice, these categories only serve as a rough guide to the space of\nmethods in the area of physics-based deep learning, and there are many works\nbelow that combine aspects from more than one of these classes.\n\nThis repository collects links to works on _deep learning algorithms for physics\nproblems_, with a particular emphasis on _fluid flow_, i.e., Navier-Stokes related\nproblems. It especially collects links to the works of the I15 lab at TUM, as\nwell as miscellaneous works from other groups. This is by no means a complete\nlist, so let us know if you come across additional papers in this area. We\nintentionally also focus on works from the _deep learning_ field, not machine\nlearning in general.\n\n![An example flow result from

You can switch between host context (cubes turn blue when you interact with them), to the guest context (cubes red when you interact with them) by pressing \"A\" and \"B\" buttons on your touch controller. Press \"SPACE\" to reset the simulation.\n\nNext, you can run a host and guest. The host acts as a server that up to three other players can connect to. Guests use the Oculus Platform SDK matchmaker to find a host to connect to. Pressing \"SPACE\" as host resets the simulation. Guests pressing \"SPACE\" disconnect from the current game and go back to matchmaking to find a new host (if there is only one host running, guests will simply reconnect).\n\nA \"Build\" menu has been added to the Unity menu so you can easily create standalone builds. Builds are created in the \"Builds\" directory under the Unity project. You can build Loopback.exe, Host.exe and Guest.exe, corresponding to each scene in the Unity project.\n\nIf you want to restrict play between yourself and friends, edit the \"Version\" string in Constants.cs and set it to some unique phrase before making builds. The host and guest will only matchmake with players that have the same version string.\n\n## License\n\nThe sample in [Assets/Scripts](Networked%20Physics/Assets/Scripts) is licensed under the BSD [License](Networked%20Physics/Assets/Scripts/LICENSE) with an additional grant of [patent rights](Networked%20Physics/Assets/Scripts/PATENTS) except as otherwise noted.\n\nThe Oculus SDK, Platform, and Avatar components are licensed under the Oculus SDK [License](LICENSE).\n\nEnjoy!\n    \nGlenn Fiedler <glenn.fiedler@gmail.com>\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "f4242f317fc1c81348308bdd69774c637c3c0f91 8"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "matt conte"}, "pushedDate": "2018-12-21T23:12:49Z", "messageHeadline": "Roll Platform SDK back to 1.10.0", "message": "Roll Platform SDK back to 1.10.0\n\nMinor changes."}}, {"node": {"additions": 262326, "author": {"name": "matt conte"}, "pushedDate": "2018-12-21T22:16:45Z", "messageHeadline": "Fix GitHub Issue #3", "message": "Fix GitHub Issue #3\n\nRevert Platform SDK upgrade to 1.24, temporarily.

The Position Based Dynamics method\nPBD is basically a method to do physics simulation. Comparing to other traditional methods like mass-spring system, FEM, SPH and FLIP, PBD is not physically accurate because no inner force of the system is calculated from physical laws. But a huge advantage of PBD is that it's very fast, and produces visually-plausible simulation results, which makes PBD perfect solution for simulation in games. \n\nIn PBD, physics is simulated by inter-particle \"constraints\", this feature makes PBD quite flexible since we can just keep adding new types of constraints to the system to simulate the physical properties we want.\n\nPBD is originally designed for cloth simulation, but newer PBD methods could supports new types of objects like rigid body and fluid.\n\nAnother reason we choose PBD is because it's easy to parallelize so that we could run it on the GPU to accelerate the simulations. As the [Paper](https://www.animation.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/2017-EG-CourseNotes.pdf) mentioned, the Jacobi solver is very suitable for Massively parallel plantform like modern GPUs.\n\n\n## 2. GPU computing in Unity\nUnity now supports GPU computing feature by adapting Microsoft's DirectCompute technique into unity. The compute shaders are written in HLSL and can utilize GPU computing in a similar fashion as CUDA: the kernels are defined in compute shaders, you pack and pass data from CPU side through compute buffers, then after compute you read data from CPU side and use it in whatever way you want.\n\nTo start with unity's compute shaders, I found these [tutorials](https://forum.unity.com/threads/tutorial-to-start-with-compute-shaders.500648/) and [examples](https://github.com/antoinefournier/XParticle) quite helpful. Starting with a simple particle system example should provide enough knowledge to begin with.\n\n\n## 3. Cloth\nThe way position based dynamics handles cloth simulation is quite simple: each vertex in the cloth is treated as a particle with various inter-particle \"constraints\", and the algorithm simply needs to make sure none of the constraints are violated at every frame. \n\nAn important thing to note is that none of these constraints are physics based; they are simply introduced to make sure the particles behave a certain way that looks correct. The distance constraint, for example, simply makes sure two connected vertices don't stretch too much beyond their starting distance. The bending constraint makes sure two connected triangles don't bend too much beyond or below a certain starting angle.\n\n![](DemoImages/ClothChart.png)\n\nMany expressive constraints are invented every year since the algorithm was first described in 2008, and the ability to add any constraint to the simulation to achieve a desired effect is one of the advantages of this algorithm.\n\n#### Cloth Plugin User Guide\nThe UI following the cloth script:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Ninjajie/Fusion/blob/master/DemoImages/ClothUI.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nInside UI you can directly change almost all controllable variables, including:\n - Time step\n - Iteration number\n - Constraint weights and vertices' mass\n\nand so on.\n\n#### Interactivity\n\nYou can set your own point constraints on the cloth in the inspector or by dragging your mouse.\n\n![](DemoImages/MouseInteraction.gif)\n\nThe cloth is completely integrated into Unity, so feel free to move/rotate it just like any other gameobject.\n\n![](DemoImages/UnityIntegration.gif)\n\nThe plugin (incompletely) supports importing meshes as clothes, but duplicate vertices coming from UVs will make the cloth model into two-pieces, the inner surface and the outer surface. As you can see from the following gif, the simulation runs correctly on both pieces.\n\n![](DemoImages/Dress.gif)\n\n## 4. Fluid\n\n#### The position based fluid\n\n\nComparing to Cloth simulation, PBD fluid, or shortly, PBF, requires not only new types of constraints, but also extra stages in the computation pipeline. As the following flow chart suggests:\n\n![](DemoImages/FluidChart.png)\n\nFluid simulation requires searching for neighboring particles, so we construct and maintain a hash grid structure for the solver, from which you can easily get the particle IDs inside any Cell or grid simply by providing the cell ID the current particle lies in.\n\nIn completing the hash grid structure, a sorting algorithm is required to perform efficient sorting on <key,value> pairs. Here parallel Bitonic sorting is adapted from Microsoft's example code of DirectX SDK. \n\n#### Fluid Plugin User Guide\nTo create a fluid simulation scene, first of all you need to create a gameobject and attach the `PBFluidScript.cs` to it as a component. In the UI element following the script:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Ninjajie/Fusion/blob/master/DemoImages/FluidUI1.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nInside the UI, you can directly change:\n - The time step \n - The amount of particles you want to have in the simulation\n - The initial velocity of the fluid chuck\n - The number of iterations the solver runs\n - The thickness of Boundary\n\nBesides, to actually view the particles, you need \n - A material for the particles, using the `Particle` shader to enable GPU instancing\n - A mesh for the individual particles\n\nIn order to make the fluid simulation interactive, the plugin enables:\n - create a cube of any size, and assign its transformation to the script's _ContainerTransform_, so that the fluid is within the container\n - create a cube defining the volume of the fluid body, the fluid particles will start moving from the position that this cube defines, assign its transformation to the _FluidChunkTransform_\n - To ignore the cube above in rendering, assign its mesh renderer to the _FluidChuckRenderer_\n\n![](DemoImages/FluidUI2.png)\n\nThe above image shows an example scene of fluid simulation. Then you are ready to go.\n\n#### Interactivity\n\nMove and resize the fluid body chunk to create the fluid body and start simulation\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal1.gif)\n\nCreate blast in the fluid by click left button on mouse.\n - Raycasting is used to find the intersection point, then a blast is created.\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal2CropedResized.gif)\n\nPause the simulation by pressing `Space`, then rescale the container by `J` `K` `L` `U` `I` `O`, press `B` to resume when you are ready.\n\n - A new hash grid and a new solver object is reconstructed when you resume the simulation.\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal3ResizedCroped.gif)\n\n## 5. More Possible Physical Object types\nThe project successfully demonstrated the flexibility of the GPU+PBD+Unity framework. Given this fact, more types of physical objects are achievable. For example, Rigid body can be easily simulated by a constraint that tries to maintain the body's original shape. \n\nFor more options, check [The Position Based Dynamics library](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/PositionBasedDynamics) on GitHub and the PBD paper for some inspirations.\n\n## 6. Performance - The power of GPU\n\n#### Performance on Cloth: Comparisons between CPU and GPU cloth\n\n_Tested on: Windows 10, i7-6500U @ 2.50GHz 12GB RAM, GeForce 940M 8GB (Personal Laptop)_\n\nThe timestep of the simulation determines how many times the entire algorithm is run per frame. A lower timestep is generally required as the resolution of the cloth increases, though the cloth will appear very stiff when the timestep is too low. In the below graph, we can see that the GPU version of the algorithm handles a decreasing timestep a lot better than the CPU.\n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance1.png)\n\nThe iteration number controls the number of times the constraints are enforced. Similar to the timestep, a higher iteration number is usually required as the simulation gets more complex; an overly-high iteration number will also make the cloth seem stiff due to the over-enforcement of the constraints. The GPU version of the algorithm also does a much better job here than the CPU version. The framerate remained consistently over 60 and did not suffer any dips like it did with the timestep. This is probably because an decreased timestep increases the number of times the entire algorithm is run, while an increased iteration number only increases the number of times the constraint portion of the algorithm is run.\n\n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance2.png)\n\n\nFinally, the GPU and CPU versions of the algorithm were tested on different resolutions of the cloth. The resolution of the cloth is essential to how real the cloth simulation looks, as a low resolution will make the cloth look blocky. The CPU version proved unable to handle anything more than 10x10, while the GPU version could handle 30x30 at a reasonable framerate. \n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance3.png)\n\n\n#### Performance on Fluid: the GPU power benchmark\n\n_Tested on: Windows 10, i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz, 16GB, GTX 1050 4GB (Personal Laptop)_\n\n_**We didn't implement the CPU version of PBF, so no comparison between CPU and GPU is provided, but as far as the authors suspect, the CPU equivalent version runs probably at <=30 fps**_\n\n * Time step vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance1.png)\n\nSimilar to Cloth, the solver needs a smaller time step when particle amount goes high. Also, you can see more subtle details in the fluid simulation when time step goes down, which shows that timestep is crucial to physical simulations. But: PBD fluid are very stable even in high time steps like 0.01sec. And the FPS doesn't suffer a lot from the change of time step.\n\n * Iteration Number vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance2.png)\n\nTheoretically, a larger number of iterations are required for more complex scene like more particles, but the whole simulation would get dramatically slowed down if you run the solver more times in a frame.\n\n * Number of Particles vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance3.png)\n\nThe number of particles to simulate is a critical factor to the FPS. As opposed to more advanced simulation techniques like Tall Cells, GPU version PBF could only decently handle ~100k particles(as of our Unity implementation). And as we have more and more particles in the scene, the simulation got farther and farther away from real-time. \n\n\n## 7.

The Position Based Dynamics method\nPBD is basically a method to do physics simulation. Comparing to other traditional methods like mass-spring system, FEM, SPH and FLIP, PBD is not physically accurate because no inner force of the system is calculated from physical laws. But a huge advantage of PBD is that it's very fast, and produces visually-plausible simulation results, which makes PBD perfect solution for simulation in games. \n\nIn PBD, physics is simulated by inter-particle \"constraints\", this feature makes PBD quite flexible since we can just keep adding new types of constraints to the system to simulate the physical properties we want.\n\nPBD is originally designed for cloth simulation, but newer PBD methods could supports new types of objects like rigid body and fluid.\n\nAnother reason we choose PBD is because it's easy to parallelize so that we could run it on the GPU to accelerate the simulations. As the [Paper](https://www.animation.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/2017-EG-CourseNotes.pdf) mentioned, the Jacobi solver is very suitable for Massively parallel plantform like modern GPUs.\n\n\n## 2. GPU computing in Unity\nUnity now supports GPU computing feature by adapting Microsoft's DirectCompute technique into unity. The compute shaders are written in HLSL and can utilize GPU computing in a similar fashion as CUDA: the kernels are defined in compute shaders, you pack and pass data from CPU side through compute buffers, then after compute you read data from CPU side and use it in whatever way you want.\n\nTo start with unity's compute shaders, I found these [tutorials](https://forum.unity.com/threads/tutorial-to-start-with-compute-shaders.500648/) and [examples](https://github.com/antoinefournier/XParticle) quite helpful. Starting with a simple particle system example should provide enough knowledge to begin with.\n\n\n## 3. Cloth\nThe way position based dynamics handles cloth simulation is quite simple: each vertex in the cloth is treated as a particle with various inter-particle \"constraints\", and the algorithm simply needs to make sure none of the constraints are violated at every frame. \n\nAn important thing to note is that none of these constraints are physics based; they are simply introduced to make sure the particles behave a certain way that looks correct. The distance constraint, for example, simply makes sure two connected vertices don't stretch too much beyond their starting distance. The bending constraint makes sure two connected triangles don't bend too much beyond or below a certain starting angle.\n\n![](DemoImages/ClothChart.png)\n\nMany expressive constraints are invented every year since the algorithm was first described in 2008, and the ability to add any constraint to the simulation to achieve a desired effect is one of the advantages of this algorithm.\n\n#### Cloth Plugin User Guide\nThe UI following the cloth script:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Ninjajie/Fusion/blob/master/DemoImages/ClothUI.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nInside UI you can directly change almost all controllable variables, including:\n - Time step\n - Iteration number\n - Constraint weights and vertices' mass\n\nand so on.\n\n#### Interactivity\n\nYou can set your own point constraints on the cloth in the inspector or by dragging your mouse.\n\n![](DemoImages/MouseInteraction.gif)\n\nThe cloth is completely integrated into Unity, so feel free to move/rotate it just like any other gameobject.\n\n![](DemoImages/UnityIntegration.gif)\n\nThe plugin (incompletely) supports importing meshes as clothes, but duplicate vertices coming from UVs will make the cloth model into two-pieces, the inner surface and the outer surface. As you can see from the following gif, the simulation runs correctly on both pieces.\n\n![](DemoImages/Dress.gif)\n\n## 4. Fluid\n\n#### The position based fluid\n\n\nComparing to Cloth simulation, PBD fluid, or shortly, PBF, requires not only new types of constraints, but also extra stages in the computation pipeline. As the following flow chart suggests:\n\n![](DemoImages/FluidChart.png)\n\nFluid simulation requires searching for neighboring particles, so we construct and maintain a hash grid structure for the solver, from which you can easily get the particle IDs inside any Cell or grid simply by providing the cell ID the current particle lies in.\n\nIn completing the hash grid structure, a sorting algorithm is required to perform efficient sorting on <key,value> pairs. Here parallel Bitonic sorting is adapted from Microsoft's example code of DirectX SDK. \n\n#### Fluid Plugin User Guide\nTo create a fluid simulation scene, first of all you need to create a gameobject and attach the `PBFluidScript.cs` to it as a component. In the UI element following the script:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Ninjajie/Fusion/blob/master/DemoImages/FluidUI1.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nInside the UI, you can directly change:\n - The time step \n - The amount of particles you want to have in the simulation\n - The initial velocity of the fluid chuck\n - The number of iterations the solver runs\n - The thickness of Boundary\n\nBesides, to actually view the particles, you need \n - A material for the particles, using the `Particle` shader to enable GPU instancing\n - A mesh for the individual particles\n\nIn order to make the fluid simulation interactive, the plugin enables:\n - create a cube of any size, and assign its transformation to the script's _ContainerTransform_, so that the fluid is within the container\n - create a cube defining the volume of the fluid body, the fluid particles will start moving from the position that this cube defines, assign its transformation to the _FluidChunkTransform_\n - To ignore the cube above in rendering, assign its mesh renderer to the _FluidChuckRenderer_\n\n![](DemoImages/FluidUI2.png)\n\nThe above image shows an example scene of fluid simulation. Then you are ready to go.\n\n#### Interactivity\n\nMove and resize the fluid body chunk to create the fluid body and start simulation\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal1.gif)\n\nCreate blast in the fluid by click left button on mouse.\n - Raycasting is used to find the intersection point, then a blast is created.\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal2CropedResized.gif)\n\nPause the simulation by pressing `Space`, then rescale the container by `J` `K` `L` `U` `I` `O`, press `B` to resume when you are ready.\n\n - A new hash grid and a new solver object is reconstructed when you resume the simulation.\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidfinal3ResizedCroped.gif)\n\n## 5. More Possible Physical Object types\nThe project successfully demonstrated the flexibility of the GPU+PBD+Unity framework. Given this fact, more types of physical objects are achievable. For example, Rigid body can be easily simulated by a constraint that tries to maintain the body's original shape. \n\nFor more options, check [The Position Based Dynamics library](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/PositionBasedDynamics) on GitHub and the PBD paper for some inspirations.\n\n## 6. Performance - The power of GPU\n\n#### Performance on Cloth: Comparisons between CPU and GPU cloth\n\n_Tested on: Windows 10, i7-6500U @ 2.50GHz 12GB RAM, GeForce 940M 8GB (Personal Laptop)_\n\nThe timestep of the simulation determines how many times the entire algorithm is run per frame. A lower timestep is generally required as the resolution of the cloth increases, though the cloth will appear very stiff when the timestep is too low. In the below graph, we can see that the GPU version of the algorithm handles a decreasing timestep a lot better than the CPU.\n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance1.png)\n\nThe iteration number controls the number of times the constraints are enforced. Similar to the timestep, a higher iteration number is usually required as the simulation gets more complex; an overly-high iteration number will also make the cloth seem stiff due to the over-enforcement of the constraints. The GPU version of the algorithm also does a much better job here than the CPU version. The framerate remained consistently over 60 and did not suffer any dips like it did with the timestep. This is probably because an decreased timestep increases the number of times the entire algorithm is run, while an increased iteration number only increases the number of times the constraint portion of the algorithm is run.\n\n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance2.png)\n\n\nFinally, the GPU and CPU versions of the algorithm were tested on different resolutions of the cloth. The resolution of the cloth is essential to how real the cloth simulation looks, as a low resolution will make the cloth look blocky. The CPU version proved unable to handle anything more than 10x10, while the GPU version could handle 30x30 at a reasonable framerate. \n\n![](DemoImages/clothPerformance3.png)\n\n\n#### Performance on Fluid: the GPU power benchmark\n\n_Tested on: Windows 10, i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz, 16GB, GTX 1050 4GB (Personal Laptop)_\n\n_**We didn't implement the CPU version of PBF, so no comparison between CPU and GPU is provided, but as far as the authors suspect, the CPU equivalent version runs probably at <=30 fps**_\n\n * Time step vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance1.png)\n\nSimilar to Cloth, the solver needs a smaller time step when particle amount goes high. Also, you can see more subtle details in the fluid simulation when time step goes down, which shows that timestep is crucial to physical simulations. But: PBD fluid are very stable even in high time steps like 0.01sec. And the FPS doesn't suffer a lot from the change of time step.\n\n * Iteration Number vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance2.png)\n\nTheoretically, a larger number of iterations are required for more complex scene like more particles, but the whole simulation would get dramatically slowed down if you run the solver more times in a frame.\n\n * Number of Particles vs. FPS\n\n![](DemoImages/fluidPerformance3.png)\n\nThe number of particles to simulate is a critical factor to the FPS. As opposed to more advanced simulation techniques like Tall Cells, GPU version PBF could only decently handle ~100k particles(as of our Unity implementation). And as we have more and more particles in the scene, the simulation got farther and farther away from real-time. \n\n\n## 7.

YapAnimator was built with ease-of-use in mind, keeping *you* sane and your designer very, *very* happy. All animations are interruptable, include completion blocks, and allow you to apply forces to them (e.g. adding the velocity from a gesture in a transition). We've included `Animatable` protocol conformance for some commonly animated types (`CG` types), but it's really easy to add conformance to any other type. **You can animate anything** that you can represent and compose with an array of `Double`s \u2014 view properties, music volume, morphing between bezier paths, colors, smoothing brush strokes, the list goes on\u2026 use your imagination!\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yapstudios/YapAnimator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yapstudios/YapAnimator)\n[![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/YapAnimator.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/YapAnimator.svg)\n[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/YapAnimator.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/YapAnimator)\n\n## Why use YapAnimator?\n\nBecause it's insanely easy to use and makes beautiful animations, that's why. There are other physics-based animation systems out there (e.g. UIKit's spring animations, Facebook's Pop), but they still require writing too much code, bookkeeping, and hand-holding for our taste. YapAnimator represents a distilled n-th iteration of code that we've been using in our own apps for years. We find it invaluable in our day-to-day and think that you will too.\n\n## Built-in Extensions\n\nYapAnimator comes with a handy extension bolted on to `CALayer` and `UIView`/`NSView`, providing one-liner animations under the `animatedLayer` and `animated` properties, respectively.\n\n![CircleAnimationExample](Docs/squirclemorph.gif)\n\n```swift\nfunc handle(gesture: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {\n\n\tif gesture.state == .began {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.cornerRadius.animate(to: squircle.bounds.width / 2.0)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.rotationZ.animate(to: .pi)\n\telse if gesture.state == .changed {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.position.instant(to: gesture.location(in: nil))\n\t} else if gesture.state == .ended {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.position.animate(to: self.view.center)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.cornerRadius.animate(to: 0)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.rotationZ.animate(to: 0)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Animators\n\nCreating a custom animator is straightforward:\n\n- `initialValue` This sets the initial value of the animator and informs it what type it will be animating.\n- `willBegin` Called just before motion starts. Return the actual value of the property that you'll be animating. This allows the animator to sync up with that value in case it was changed outside of the scope of the animator. *(optional)*\n- `eachFrame` Called each frame of the animation \u2014\u00a0this is typically where you'd apply the animator's `current.value` to the property that you're animating. You can also use it to check values to trigger other actions / animations.\n\n```swift\nframeAnimator = YapAnimator(initialValue: square.frame, willBegin: { [unowned self] in\n\treturn self.square.frame\n}, eachFrame: { [unowned self] (animator) in\n\tself.square.frame = animator.current.value\n})\n```\n\n![SquareFrameExample](Docs/squareframe.gif)\n\n```swift\nframeAnimator.bounciness = 1.5\n\nframeAnimator.animate(to: square.frame.insetBy(dx: -50, dy: -50), completion: { animator, wasInterrupted in\n\tif !wasInterrupted {\n\t\t// animate back to the original value\n\t\tanimator.animate(to: animator.current.value.insetBy(dx: 50, dy: 50))\n\t}\n})\n```\n\n## Questions?\n\nFeel free to [ask your question in an issue](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapAnimator/issues/new). We will respond there, and  amend this read me/start a wiki if the answer seems like it would benefit others.\n\n## Credits\n\nYapAnimator is owned and maintained by [Yap Studios](http://www.yapstudios.com).\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 41, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "cd4fd5167708acf1416f4f97683f2be3ea1f9ae6 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-12-20T19:05:16Z", "messageHeadline": "Fix compilation issue in Swift 4", "message": "Fix compilation issue in Swift 4\n\nFixes #9"}}, {"node": {"additions": 7, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-09-06T19:49:23Z", "messageHeadline": "Remove dead animators in pass after updating", "message": "Remove dead animators in pass after updating"}}, {"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Emory Al-Imam"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-20T03:25:10Z", "messageHeadline": "Add SourceTree icon.", "message": "Add SourceTree icon."}}, {"node": {"additions": 26, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-20T03:23:29Z", "messageHeadline": "Add X and Y rotation animators to AnimatableLayer", "message": "Add X and Y rotation animators to AnimatableLayer"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-07T23:18:17Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README", "message": "Update README"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-07T23:15:57Z", "messageHeadline": "Update podspec to point to 1.2.0", "message": "Update podspec to point to 1.2.0"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2046, "author": {"name": "Ollie Wagner"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-07T23:07:26Z", "messageHeadline": "Add support for macOS (thanks to https://github.com/samleegray for ki\u2026", "message": "Add support for macOS (thanks to https://github.com/samleegray for kicking this off)"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Elvis Nu\u00f1ez"}, "pushedDate": "2017-07-04T18:15:41Z", "messageHeadline": "Fix project title in credits", "message": "Fix project title in credits"}}, {"node": {"additions": 5, "author": {"name": "Emory Al-Imam"}, "pushedDate": "2017-06-28T21:40:12Z", "messageHeadline": "Add Credits section to Readme.

YapAnimator was built with ease-of-use in mind, keeping *you* sane and your designer very, *very* happy. All animations are interruptable, include completion blocks, and allow you to apply forces to them (e.g. adding the velocity from a gesture in a transition). We've included `Animatable` protocol conformance for some commonly animated types (`CG` types), but it's really easy to add conformance to any other type. **You can animate anything** that you can represent and compose with an array of `Double`s \u2014 view properties, music volume, morphing between bezier paths, colors, smoothing brush strokes, the list goes on\u2026 use your imagination!\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yapstudios/YapAnimator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yapstudios/YapAnimator)\n[![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/YapAnimator.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/YapAnimator.svg)\n[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/YapAnimator.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/YapAnimator)\n\n## Why use YapAnimator?\n\nBecause it's insanely easy to use and makes beautiful animations, that's why. There are other physics-based animation systems out there (e.g. UIKit's spring animations, Facebook's Pop), but they still require writing too much code, bookkeeping, and hand-holding for our taste. YapAnimator represents a distilled n-th iteration of code that we've been using in our own apps for years. We find it invaluable in our day-to-day and think that you will too.\n\n## Built-in Extensions\n\nYapAnimator comes with a handy extension bolted on to `CALayer` and `UIView`/`NSView`, providing one-liner animations under the `animatedLayer` and `animated` properties, respectively.\n\n![CircleAnimationExample](Docs/squirclemorph.gif)\n\n```swift\nfunc handle(gesture: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {\n\n\tif gesture.state == .began {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.cornerRadius.animate(to: squircle.bounds.width / 2.0)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.rotationZ.animate(to: .pi)\n\telse if gesture.state == .changed {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.position.instant(to: gesture.location(in: nil))\n\t} else if gesture.state == .ended {\n\t\tsquircle.animated.position.animate(to: self.view.center)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.cornerRadius.animate(to: 0)\n\t\tsquircle.animated.rotationZ.animate(to: 0)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Animators\n\nCreating a custom animator is straightforward:\n\n- `initialValue` This sets the initial value of the animator and informs it what type it will be animating.\n- `willBegin` Called just before motion starts. Return the actual value of the property that you'll be animating. This allows the animator to sync up with that value in case it was changed outside of the scope of the animator. *(optional)*\n- `eachFrame` Called each frame of the animation \u2014\u00a0this is typically where you'd apply the animator's `current.value` to the property that you're animating. You can also use it to check values to trigger other actions / animations.\n\n```swift\nframeAnimator = YapAnimator(initialValue: square.frame, willBegin: { [unowned self] in\n\treturn self.square.frame\n}, eachFrame: { [unowned self] (animator) in\n\tself.square.frame = animator.current.value\n})\n```\n\n![SquareFrameExample](Docs/squareframe.gif)\n\n```swift\nframeAnimator.bounciness = 1.5\n\nframeAnimator.animate(to: square.frame.insetBy(dx: -50, dy: -50), completion: { animator, wasInterrupted in\n\tif !wasInterrupted {\n\t\t// animate back to the original value\n\t\tanimator.animate(to: animator.current.value.insetBy(dx: 50, dy: 50))\n\t}\n})\n```\n\n## Questions?\n\nFeel free to [ask your question in an issue](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapAnimator/issues/new). We will respond there, and  amend this read me/start a wiki if the answer seems like it would benefit others.\n\n## Credits\n\nYapAnimator is owned and maintained by [Yap Studios](http://www.yapstudios.com).\n"}, "erincatto/box2d-lite": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "erincatto/box2d-lite", "diskUsage": 754, "name": "box2d-lite", "owner": {"login": "erincatto"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "CMake"}, {"name": "C"}, {"name": "C++"}, {"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "Batchfile"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-01-03T00:20:12Z", "pushedAt": "2020-01-10T04:32:10Z", "object": {"text": "# Box2D-Lite\nBox2D-Lite is a small 2D physics engine.

It's possible that not everything in there actually works\n- Everything in the scene starts with the \"TestSceneInitializer\" script, which spawns the physics objects\n- The physics simulation is all done through \"PhysicsSystem\". This is where the fixed update is called and all other systems are manually called from it:\n  - UniformGravitySystem: Modifies rigidbody velocities to simulate gravity\n  - RigidBodySystem: handles moving rigidbodies based on their velocity\n  - UpdateColliderPoseSystem: handles making colliders follow their parented rigidbody (this is still incomplete, might be replaced with new Transform System later)\n  - ComputeColliderAABBSystem: computes an AABB for each collider\n  - BroadphaseSystem: the goal of this system is to ultimately produce a list of \"CollisionPairs\", which are pairs of collider entities which are potentially overlapping. It does that in three main steps:\n    - ComputeAndSortMortonCodes: sort colliders in order of morton codes (also known as z-order curve)\n    - BuildBVH: Creates a BVH with all collider AABBs\n    - BuildCollisionPairsParallel: finds overlapping AABBs and stores them as pairs\n  - ContactsGenerationSystem: This system's jobs is to take all collision pairs from the previous step and do the actual collision test on them to generate \"CollisionManifold\"s\n  - ConstraintSolverSystem: uses the CollisionManifolds and feeds them to a constraints solver that will compute a set of forces to apply to all rigidbodies in response to the constraints\n  \n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 20, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor":

https://trello.com/b/XcYxQFrh/ecsphysics\n\nForum discussion: https://forum.unity.com/threads/physics-in-pure-ecs.531716/\n\n# Overview\n- \"TestScene_ECS\" is the main test scene. Press play to see the physics simulation happen. Modify the parameters under the \"Init\" GameObject in the scene (The \"TestScene_PhysX\" scene is for comparing with Unity's built-in physics)\n- There are some additional settings stored in the \"\\PhysicsEngine\\Data\\Resources\\DefaultPhysicsSettings\" ScriptableObject. It's possible that not everything in there actually works\n- Everything in the scene starts with the \"TestSceneInitializer\" script, which spawns the physics objects\n- The physics simulation is all done through \"PhysicsSystem\". This is where the fixed update is called and all other systems are manually called from it:\n  - UniformGravitySystem: Modifies rigidbody velocities to simulate gravity\n  - RigidBodySystem: handles moving rigidbodies based on their velocity\n  - UpdateColliderPoseSystem: handles making colliders follow their parented rigidbody (this is still incomplete, might be replaced with new Transform System later)\n  - ComputeColliderAABBSystem: computes an AABB for each collider\n  - BroadphaseSystem: the goal of this system is to ultimately produce a list of \"CollisionPairs\", which are pairs of collider entities which are potentially overlapping. It does that in three main steps:\n    - ComputeAndSortMortonCodes: sort colliders in order of morton codes (also known as z-order curve)\n    - BuildBVH: Creates a BVH with all collider AABBs\n    - BuildCollisionPairsParallel: finds overlapping AABBs and stores them as pairs\n  - ContactsGenerationSystem: This system's jobs is to take all collision pairs from the previous step and do the actual collision test on them to generate \"CollisionManifold\"s\n  - ConstraintSolverSystem: uses the CollisionManifolds and feeds them to a constraints solver that will compute a set of forces to apply to all rigidbodies in response to the constraints\n  \n"}, "adrenak/tork": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "adrenak/tork", "diskUsage": 11969, "name": "tork", "owner": {"login": "adrenak"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C#"}, {"name": "ShaderLab"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-04-08T08:32:30Z", "pushedAt": "2020-04-26T19:57:17Z", "object": {"text": "# Tork\r\nAn arcade vehicle system for Unity\r\n\r\n# Intro\r\nTork is not meant to be a realistic vehicle physics solution. It is best deployed in games where driving realism, especially at high velocities, is secondary. For example, demolition derby style games or games where driving is a secondary gameplay element. You could probably get away using it in a parking game.\r\n\r\nTork has its own Wheel physics component simply called `TorkWheel` which provides a greatly simplified friction computation mechanism. There are only three tweakable parametes: `forward grip`, `sideways grip` and `rolling friction`. \r\n\r\nIt provides spring customization which is quite similar to the inbuilt `WheelCollider` in Unity.\r\n\r\n`TorkWheel` also provides recommended values and guidelines for tweaking values.\r\n\r\n# Components\r\n\r\n`Vehicle` is the central class. It stores instances of all the `Core` and `AddOn` components in the car and this provides a single point for accessing these components. `Vehicle` class doesn't have any features of it's own and only facilitates in access.\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n### TorkWheel\r\nA simplified version of Unity's `Wheel Collider`. Much of the information of this is in the Intro section above.\r\n\r\n### Ackermann\r\nTork uses Ackermann steering to turn the wheels in a realistic manner.\r\n\r\n### Motor\r\nEssentially the engine of the vehicle. Has a `maxTorque` field that determines the maximum torque it can deliver. It also distributes it among the wheels smartly using the `Ackermann` component of the vehicle. Currently it only supports `All Wheel Drive` with other modes coming soon.\r\n  \r\n`Value` is the normalized value of the engines output. So `.5` would mean the engine is creating `maxTorque/2` torque.\r\n  \r\n`maxReverseInput` is the highest negative `value` the engine will output. This is because engines usually reverse at and up to a lower speed.\r\n\r\n### Brakes\r\nVery similar to `Motor` except that it applies braking torque on the wheels. Please see source to see the similarities.\r\n\r\n### Steering\r\nA layer of added feature over `Ackermann`. It stores the maximum steer angle the `Ackermann` will be sent as well as the rate at which the steering happens.\r\n\r\n## Add Ons\r\nAddOns are scripts that can be used to add or modify the vehicles behaviour. These derive from `VehicleAddOn` so that `Vehicle` can store them in a list and provide `GetAddOn<T>()` a method that allows any consumer to access the add on by type.\r\n\r\nThe add ons shipped with Tork are\r\n\r\n### CenterOfMassAssigner\r\nAssigns the center of mass of the vehicle. It is to be attached on a GameObject that represents the center of mass. You'd pretty much always need this class. Use it to make sure your center of mass is lower else the vehicle will flip on sharp turns.\r\n\r\n### AntiRoll\r\nVehicles in real life also have anti roll bars that try to keep the vehicle grounded based on the difference in compression of the horizontally opposite wheels. So when you're taking a sharp right turn, the anti roll bars help ensure you don't flip the car anti-clockwise (to the left). \r\n  \r\n### DownForceVsSpeed\r\nApplies a down force on the car to simulate better aerodynamics. You'd normally want a linear curve\r\n  \r\n### MidAirStabilization\r\nA pretty arcadish feature that tries to ensure that the vehicle lands flat on the ground. When the vehicle is in the air it applies counter torque based on the orientation. \r\n\r\n### MidAirStabilization\r\nAnother arcasish feature that allows the vehicle to be steered in air.\r\n\r\n### MaxSteerAndleVsSpeed\r\nUsed to mimic real life driving by changing the max angle by which the wheels will rotate. Unless you're a bad driver, you won't steer the wheels all the way at high speeds and flip it. This class simulates that.\r\n\r\n### TorkWheelViewSync\r\nSynchronises the wheel meshes with the rotation and position of their respective `TorkWheel` objects.\r\n\r\n### Ideas\r\nMany, many addons can be made. Some ideas I have: A `BrakeLights` that makes the tail lamps illuminate. `SteeringWheelSync` that rotates the wheel along with the steering input.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\nThe way input is provided and handled by the code and add on scripts may change, especially because it's like that as more add ons accumulate, it'd be good to make it available for reading some a common place. For now `IVehicleDriver` interface is to be extended. `KeyboardVehicleDriver` is inbuilt in Tork. \r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nA demo scene and script is provided inside `Tork/Samples/`\r\n\r\n### Forks\r\nFor a DOTS implementation of Tork v1, check out [@PragneshRathod901's fork](https://github.com/PragneshRathod901/Tork)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[@github](https://www.github.com/adrenak)  \r\n[@www](http://www.vatsalambastha.com)  \r\n[@npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~adrenak)  \r\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 37, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "0fee0760081d6fe8e5118fa0231a2bcd1e59aedd 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 9, "author": {"name": "semantic-release-bot"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-26T19:57:02Z", "messageHeadline": "chore(release): 2.2.0 [skip ci]", "message": "chore(release): 2.2.0 [skip ci]\n\n# [2.2.0](https://github.com/adrenak/tork/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0) (2020-04-26)\n\n### Features\n\n* Add AutoDrive ([22bb006](https://github.com/adrenak/tork/commit/22bb0061a6fad454f9823e947fe46e69f384ad93))\n* Add AutoDrive addon ([dbed6e1](https://github.com/adrenak/tork/commit/dbed6e171d6dafb909dce9f7ed157141a36768fe))"}}, {"node": {"additions": 280, "author": {"name": "Vatsal Ambastha"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-26T19:56:05Z", "messageHeadline": "feat: Add AutoDrive addon", "message": "feat: Add AutoDrive addon\n\nAckermann code refactored and cleaned up.

It is best deployed in games where driving realism, especially at high velocities, is secondary. For example, demolition derby style games or games where driving is a secondary gameplay element. You could probably get away using it in a parking game.\r\n\r\nTork has its own Wheel physics component simply called `TorkWheel` which provides a greatly simplified friction computation mechanism. There are only three tweakable parametes: `forward grip`, `sideways grip` and `rolling friction`. \r\n\r\nIt provides spring customization which is quite similar to the inbuilt `WheelCollider` in Unity.\r\n\r\n`TorkWheel` also provides recommended values and guidelines for tweaking values.\r\n\r\n# Components\r\n\r\n`Vehicle` is the central class. It stores instances of all the `Core` and `AddOn` components in the car and this provides a single point for accessing these components. `Vehicle` class doesn't have any features of it's own and only facilitates in access.\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n### TorkWheel\r\nA simplified version of Unity's `Wheel Collider`. Much of the information of this is in the Intro section above.\r\n\r\n### Ackermann\r\nTork uses Ackermann steering to turn the wheels in a realistic manner.\r\n\r\n### Motor\r\nEssentially the engine of the vehicle. Has a `maxTorque` field that determines the maximum torque it can deliver. It also distributes it among the wheels smartly using the `Ackermann` component of the vehicle. Currently it only supports `All Wheel Drive` with other modes coming soon.\r\n  \r\n`Value` is the normalized value of the engines output. So `.5` would mean the engine is creating `maxTorque/2` torque.\r\n  \r\n`maxReverseInput` is the highest negative `value` the engine will output. This is because engines usually reverse at and up to a lower speed.\r\n\r\n### Brakes\r\nVery similar to `Motor` except that it applies braking torque on the wheels. Please see source to see the similarities.\r\n\r\n### Steering\r\nA layer of added feature over `Ackermann`. It stores the maximum steer angle the `Ackermann` will be sent as well as the rate at which the steering happens.\r\n\r\n## Add Ons\r\nAddOns are scripts that can be used to add or modify the vehicles behaviour. These derive from `VehicleAddOn` so that `Vehicle` can store them in a list and provide `GetAddOn<T>()` a method that allows any consumer to access the add on by type.\r\n\r\nThe add ons shipped with Tork are\r\n\r\n### CenterOfMassAssigner\r\nAssigns the center of mass of the vehicle. It is to be attached on a GameObject that represents the center of mass. You'd pretty much always need this class. Use it to make sure your center of mass is lower else the vehicle will flip on sharp turns.\r\n\r\n### AntiRoll\r\nVehicles in real life also have anti roll bars that try to keep the vehicle grounded based on the difference in compression of the horizontally opposite wheels. So when you're taking a sharp right turn, the anti roll bars help ensure you don't flip the car anti-clockwise (to the left). \r\n  \r\n### DownForceVsSpeed\r\nApplies a down force on the car to simulate better aerodynamics. You'd normally want a linear curve\r\n  \r\n### MidAirStabilization\r\nA pretty arcadish feature that tries to ensure that the vehicle lands flat on the ground. When the vehicle is in the air it applies counter torque based on the orientation. \r\n\r\n### MidAirStabilization\r\nAnother arcasish feature that allows the vehicle to be steered in air.\r\n\r\n### MaxSteerAndleVsSpeed\r\nUsed to mimic real life driving by changing the max angle by which the wheels will rotate. Unless you're a bad driver, you won't steer the wheels all the way at high speeds and flip it. This class simulates that.\r\n\r\n### TorkWheelViewSync\r\nSynchronises the wheel meshes with the rotation and position of their respective `TorkWheel` objects.\r\n\r\n### Ideas\r\nMany, many addons can be made. Some ideas I have: A `BrakeLights` that makes the tail lamps illuminate. `SteeringWheelSync` that rotates the wheel along with the steering input.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\nThe way input is provided and handled by the code and add on scripts may change, especially because it's like that as more add ons accumulate, it'd be good to make it available for reading some a common place. For now `IVehicleDriver` interface is to be extended. `KeyboardVehicleDriver` is inbuilt in Tork. \r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nA demo scene and script is provided inside `Tork/Samples/`\r\n\r\n### Forks\r\nFor a DOTS implementation of Tork v1, check out [@PragneshRathod901's fork](https://github.com/PragneshRathod901/Tork)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[@github](https://www.github.com/adrenak)  \r\n[@www](http://www.vatsalambastha.com)  \r\n[@npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~adrenak)  \r\n"}, "wbierbower/awesome-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "wbierbower/awesome-physics", "diskUsage": 31, "name": "awesome-physics", "owner": {"login": "wbierbower"}, "languages": {"nodes": []}, "createdAt": "2017-09-23T20:29:18Z", "pushedAt": "2019-07-17T14:29:09Z", "object": {"text": "# Awesome Physics  [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)\n\n\ud83c\udf0c A collaborative list of awesome software for exploring Physics concepts.

So why is it so hard to get right, especially on the web? While mobile device SDK's have physics-based libraries built-in, web developers are missing a straight-forward way to add physics to their sites. This talk aims to solve that.

(less than 300 lines!)\n* It's open source- do what you want with it MIT licensed\n\n## How do I run it?\nThis demo showcases new feature added in Unity 2018.1, and has been tested with  2018.1b6. [Any release after that should be fine](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta-download). Once you have cloned the repository, simply open `Scenes/SampleScene.unity`. There's a fairly basic little set up here, a floor, one wall to bounce off and of course, our physics system (its attached to the Physics Spawner game object). The floor and wall just has regular Unity colliders attached, nothing special there. The spawner only has 3 public properties, Mesh, Material and Spawn direction.\n* Mesh and Material set the assets you want to render the physics objects with. Defaults to a pinkish cube.\n* Spawn Direction defaults to the walls transform. The initial velocity for physics object will be angled towards this transform, spraying out in a satisfying arch.\n\n## Wheres the code?\nIts all contained in [`SimpleJobifiedPhysics.cs`](/Assets/SimpleJobifiedPhysics.cs).\n\n## How does it work?\nUnlike unity game objects and rigidbodies, our physics objects aren't represented by concrete objects in this engine, but by a \"structure of arrays'. At the top of SimpleJobifiedPhysics we define a whole bunch of NativeArrays that hold all the various properties that make up a physics object. If you imagine these laid out in a table or excel sheet, each row across all the arrays is an individual object. \n\nPosition | Velocity | Sleeping | RenderingMatrix\n------------ | -------------|------------ | -------------\nVector3 | Vector3 | int | Matrix4x4\nThe position of the obect after the previous update | The direction and speed the object is moving in | <ul><li>Sleeping == 0, the object is moving.</li><li>Sleeping >= 0, the objet is stable. Counter gets incremented every frame the object sleeps for.</li></ul>  | We need this to draw the object with Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)\n\nOkay, there are 5 steps in running this physics engine! All of these steps are implemented as an [`IJobParallelFor`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobParallelFor.html) job. These jobs split the work up into batches and run it on all free CPU cores in the system - allowing us to process a lot of stuff very fast.\n\n1. Force Accumulation - Forces are things that affect the Velocity of our physics objects. Our first task is to calculate all these forces and merge them into Velocity. This demo only ships with one force generator - `GravityJob`. As long as an object isn't sleeping, we apply gravity to it. Once we have done this we will know how are we want to move\n1. Collision Detection - Now we know how much Velocity is acting on our object, we can use a raycast to see if it would hit anything if it moved the maximum amount it was allowed to move this frame (`float distance = (Velocities[i] * DeltaTime).magnitude;`). We use Unity's new batch raycasting system, [`RaycastCommand`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/RaycastCommand.html). Its built on the Job system and runs our casts over all the available CPU cores, just like the rest of our physics engine! Once we have done this we will know how far its safe to move.\n1. Velocity Integration - Now we know how far we can move, we have to integrate it onto our position. We do this in the most simple way possible, adding the velocity scaled by delta time to the position (Euler Integration).\n1. Collision Response - Here we can respond if an object actually hits a collider in the world. In this demo, we reflect the velocity so the colliding object bounces. We also dampen the objects velocity to simulate friction. This damping effect is what ultimately brings an object to a stop. When we detect an object has next to no velocity acting on it we mark it as sleeping -so no forces affect it at all and its position is totally stable. Once an object has been stable for 15 updates, we respawn it to keep the simulation going!\n1. Rendering - Finally, we calculate a matrix we can send to Unity's renderer to correctly position the physics object on the screen. We use `Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)` to draw all the physics objects because gosh its fast!\n\nAll of these steps are implemented as one (or more!) unity jobs and each job in the chain depends on the one that came before it, that's why were passing the [`JobHandle`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) from each job into the next one we schedule. This tells unity about that dependency, and it won't schedule a job higher up in the chain until the previous job has been totally completed \n\n### What next?\nWell, that's kinda all there is to it in this demo - there is a lot of room for improvement though if you want to use this as a foundation to build your own physics system! Some of these ideas I have already implemented in HyperPhysics and might write about in the future - others are just cool things to experiment with\n\n* Currently there is only one force generator, gravity. Try implementing Springs (google for Hooke's Law!), or bouncy, or maybe even joints and constraints!\n* Currently all objects experience the same gravity in the same direction - why not try adding more interesting gravity implementations like gravity attractors, gravity that makes you fall towards the closest tiny planet (like Mario galaxy!). you could even experiment with trigger volumes that slow down all objects that enter them! \n* The simulation size is currently limited to 1023 objects - this is because that is the most `Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)` can draw in a single call. Try drawing in batches so you can break this limit and \n* The part of this system that scales the worst is our dependancy of Unity's `RaycastCommand`. Try to write your own raycast system (the custom raycaster in HyperPhysics is the main reason its so fast and can handle so many objects).\n* We are currently treating our Physics Objects as zero mass particles... they cant even rotate! try adding mass and rotations to the system.\n\nHave fun! \nlove,\n[@LotteMakesStuff ![twitter

border='0' alt='Become a Patron!' /></a>\nSimplePhysics is a Unity 2018.1 demo showcasing a custom physics system which has all of its processing via the new Unity Jobs system.\n![demo gif - boxes flying everywhere!](/Docs/phys.gif)\n* Its a simplified, bare-bones version of the same concepts behind [LotteMakesStuff's HyperPhysics engine](https://twitter.com/LotteMakesStuff/status/964612077708070912).\n* It uses the new Unity 2018.1 Job system to run the physics simulation across all your CPUs cores at once.\n  * Its a good nontrivial example of how to chain job dependencies together and how to use NativeArrays\n  * It demos Unity's RaycastCommand - a new way of sending batches of raycasts to be processed in jobs\n* It's tiny!! (less than 300 lines!)\n* It's open source- do what you want with it MIT licensed\n\n## How do I run it?\nThis demo showcases new feature added in Unity 2018.1, and has been tested with  2018.1b6. [Any release after that should be fine](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta-download). Once you have cloned the repository, simply open `Scenes/SampleScene.unity`. There's a fairly basic little set up here, a floor, one wall to bounce off and of course, our physics system (its attached to the Physics Spawner game object). The floor and wall just has regular Unity colliders attached, nothing special there. The spawner only has 3 public properties, Mesh, Material and Spawn direction.\n* Mesh and Material set the assets you want to render the physics objects with. Defaults to a pinkish cube.\n* Spawn Direction defaults to the walls transform. The initial velocity for physics object will be angled towards this transform, spraying out in a satisfying arch.\n\n## Wheres the code?\nIts all contained in [`SimpleJobifiedPhysics.cs`](/Assets/SimpleJobifiedPhysics.cs).\n\n## How does it work?\nUnlike unity game objects and rigidbodies, our physics objects aren't represented by concrete objects in this engine, but by a \"structure of arrays'. At the top of SimpleJobifiedPhysics we define a whole bunch of NativeArrays that hold all the various properties that make up a physics object. If you imagine these laid out in a table or excel sheet, each row across all the arrays is an individual object. \n\nPosition | Velocity | Sleeping | RenderingMatrix\n------------ | -------------|------------ | -------------\nVector3 | Vector3 | int | Matrix4x4\nThe position of the obect after the previous update | The direction and speed the object is moving in | <ul><li>Sleeping == 0, the object is moving.</li><li>Sleeping >= 0, the objet is stable. Counter gets incremented every frame the object sleeps for.</li></ul>  | We need this to draw the object with Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)\n\nOkay, there are 5 steps in running this physics engine! All of these steps are implemented as an [`IJobParallelFor`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJobParallelFor.html) job. These jobs split the work up into batches and run it on all free CPU cores in the system - allowing us to process a lot of stuff very fast.\n\n1. Force Accumulation - Forces are things that affect the Velocity of our physics objects. Our first task is to calculate all these forces and merge them into Velocity. This demo only ships with one force generator - `GravityJob`. As long as an object isn't sleeping, we apply gravity to it. Once we have done this we will know how are we want to move\n1. Collision Detection - Now we know how much Velocity is acting on our object, we can use a raycast to see if it would hit anything if it moved the maximum amount it was allowed to move this frame (`float distance = (Velocities[i] * DeltaTime).magnitude;`). We use Unity's new batch raycasting system, [`RaycastCommand`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/RaycastCommand.html). Its built on the Job system and runs our casts over all the available CPU cores, just like the rest of our physics engine! Once we have done this we will know how far its safe to move.\n1. Velocity Integration - Now we know how far we can move, we have to integrate it onto our position. We do this in the most simple way possible, adding the velocity scaled by delta time to the position (Euler Integration).\n1. Collision Response - Here we can respond if an object actually hits a collider in the world. In this demo, we reflect the velocity so the colliding object bounces. We also dampen the objects velocity to simulate friction. This damping effect is what ultimately brings an object to a stop. When we detect an object has next to no velocity acting on it we mark it as sleeping -so no forces affect it at all and its position is totally stable. Once an object has been stable for 15 updates, we respawn it to keep the simulation going!\n1. Rendering - Finally, we calculate a matrix we can send to Unity's renderer to correctly position the physics object on the screen. We use `Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)` to draw all the physics objects because gosh its fast!\n\nAll of these steps are implemented as one (or more!) unity jobs and each job in the chain depends on the one that came before it, that's why were passing the [`JobHandle`](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) from each job into the next one we schedule. This tells unity about that dependency, and it won't schedule a job higher up in the chain until the previous job has been totally completed \n\n### What next?\nWell, that's kinda all there is to it in this demo - there is a lot of room for improvement though if you want to use this as a foundation to build your own physics system! Some of these ideas I have already implemented in HyperPhysics and might write about in the future - others are just cool things to experiment with\n\n* Currently there is only one force generator, gravity. Try implementing Springs (google for Hooke's Law!), or bouncy, or maybe even joints and constraints!\n* Currently all objects experience the same gravity in the same direction - why not try adding more interesting gravity implementations like gravity attractors, gravity that makes you fall towards the closest tiny planet (like Mario galaxy!). you could even experiment with trigger volumes that slow down all objects that enter them! \n* The simulation size is currently limited to 1023 objects - this is because that is the most `Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced(...)` can draw in a single call. Try drawing in batches so you can break this limit and \n* The part of this system that scales the worst is our dependancy of Unity's `RaycastCommand`. Try to write your own raycast system (the custom raycaster in HyperPhysics is the main reason its so fast and can handle so many objects).\n* We are currently treating our Physics Objects as zero mass particles... they cant even rotate! try adding mass and rotations to the system.\n\nHave fun! \nlove,\n[@LotteMakesStuff ![twitter icon](http://i.imgur.com/wWzX9uB.png)](http://www.twitter.com/LotteMakesStuff)\n\n"}, "FamousArchives/physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "FamousArchives/physics", "diskUsage": 492, "name": "physics", "owner": {"login": "FamousArchives"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "JavaScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2014-04-09T17:48:12Z", "pushedAt": "2014-07-29T01:18:56Z", "object": {"text": "Physics: Famo.us core physics engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/physics.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/physics)\n====================================\n\nCore engine controlling animations via physical simulation.\n\n## Files\n\n- bodies/Body.js: A unit controlled by the physics engine which serves to\n  provide position and orientation.\n- bodies/Circle.js: An elemental circle-shaped Body in the physics engine.\n- bodies/Particle.js:  A unit controlled by the physics engine which serves to\n  provide position.\n- bodies/Rectangle.js: An elemental rectangle-shaped Body in the physics engine.\n- constraints/Collision.js: Allows for two circular bodies to collide and bounce off each other.\n- constraints/Constraint.js: Allows for two circular bodies to collide and bounce off each other.\n- constraints/Curve.js: A constraint that keeps a physics body on a given implicit curve \n  regardless of other physical forces are applied to it.\n- constraints/Distance.js:  A constraint that keeps a physics body a given distance away from a given anchor, or another attached body.\n- constraints/Snap.js: A spring constraint is like a spring force, except that it is always numerically stable (even for low periods).\n- constraints/Surface.js: A constraint that keeps a physics body on a given implicit surface \n  regardless of other physical forces are applied to it.\n- constraints/Wall.js:  A wall describes an infinite two-dimensional plane that physics bodies can collide with.\n- constraints/Walls.js: Walls combines one or more Wall primitives and exposes a simple \n  API to interact with several walls at once\n- forces/Drag.js: Drag is a force that opposes velocity.

Status](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/physics.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/physics)\n====================================\n\nCore engine controlling animations via physical simulation.\n\n## Files\n\n- bodies/Body.js: A unit controlled by the physics engine which serves to\n  provide position and orientation.\n- bodies/Circle.js: An elemental circle-shaped Body in the physics engine.\n- bodies/Particle.js:  A unit controlled by the physics engine which serves to\n  provide position.\n- bodies/Rectangle.js: An elemental rectangle-shaped Body in the physics engine.\n- constraints/Collision.js: Allows for two circular bodies to collide and bounce off each other.\n- constraints/Constraint.js: Allows for two circular bodies to collide and bounce off each other.\n- constraints/Curve.js: A constraint that keeps a physics body on a given implicit curve \n  regardless of other physical forces are applied to it.\n- constraints/Distance.js:  A constraint that keeps a physics body a given distance away from a given anchor, or another attached body.\n- constraints/Snap.js: A spring constraint is like a spring force, except that it is always numerically stable (even for low periods).\n- constraints/Surface.js: A constraint that keeps a physics body on a given implicit surface \n  regardless of other physical forces are applied to it.\n- constraints/Wall.js:  A wall describes an infinite two-dimensional plane that physics bodies can collide with.\n- constraints/Walls.js: Walls combines one or more Wall primitives and exposes a simple \n  API to interact with several walls at once\n- forces/Drag.js: Drag is a force that opposes velocity. Attach it to the\n  physics engine to slow down a physics body in motion.\n- forces/Force.js: Force base class.\n- forces/Repulsion.js: Repulsion is a force that repels (attracts) bodies away\n  (towards) each other.\n- forces/RotationalDrag.js:  Rotational drag is a force that opposes angular\n  velocity. Attach it to a physics body to slow down its rotation.\n- forces/RotationalSpring.js:  A force that rotates a physics body back to\n  target Euler angles.\n- forces/Spring.js: A force that moves a physics body to a location with a\n  spring motion.\n- forces/VectorField.js:  A force that moves a physics body to a location with a spring motion.\n- integrators/SymplecticEuler.js:  Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n  Integrator. Manages updating a physics body's state over time.\n- integrators/verlet.js:  Manages updating a physics body's state over time.\n  (deprecated)\n- PhysicsEngine.js: The Physics Engine is responsible for mediating Bodies and \n  their interaction with forces and constraints.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Reference Docs][reference-documentation]\n- [Animating][animating]\n- [Pitfalls][pitfalls]\n\n## Maintainer\n\n- David Valdman <david@famo.us>\n\n\n## Famous Physics Framework\n\nThe framework has three main parts that application developers should expect to\nuse:\n\n### Bodies\n\nBodies represent physical objects. For example, the Circle class represents a\nsolid ball, the Rectangle class represents a solid rectangular prism.\n\n### Constraints\n\nConstraints represent ways that objects can be connected. For example, you might\nwant two objects to behave as is there were a Rope or a StiffSpring connecting\nthem.\n\n### Forces\n\nForces can be thought of as soft constraints. So while StiffSpring is a\nconstraint, Spring is a force.

(**Free Dyno** in **Europe**) which causes the example sometimes to take **about 1 minute to load**._\n\n- Play it here - [phaser3-multiplayer-example](http://phaser3-multiplayer-example.herokuapp.com/)  \n  _It works best if your latency is below 100ms, which should the case if you are located in Europe._\n\n## Key Features\n\n- The physics is entirely calculated on the Server\n- Automatically manages Rooms (new Phaser instances)\n- Physics debugging version\n- A nice Stats page\n\n## Video\n\nWatch it on YouTube\n\n[![thumbnail](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n8gJQEfA18s/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCpxKgRIHTOZICjxwhdKSrtsIrOJw)](https://youtu.be/n8gJQEfA18s)\n\n## Matter Physics vs Arcade Physics\n\nThis example includes 2 different games. One with MatterJS and the other with Arcade. The MatterJS game has only one level. The Arcade one is a simple platformer game with 3 levels.\n\nSo in total, you can play 4 different levels. For each level, the server creates a new room, which creates a new Phaser instance, which are completely isolated from each other. There can be up to 4 players per room.\n\n## Structure\n\n```bash\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 client  # Contains all the code the client will need\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 physics # This is for debugging the physics (Arcade and MatterJS)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server  # Contains the code running on the NodeJS server\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stats   # The stats page will show useful information about the server\n```\n\n## How To Use\n\nTo clone and run this template, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\n\nYou also need to install some additional packages since this example uses [Node-Canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas). See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling).\n\nFrom your command line:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repository\n$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/yandeu/phaser3-multiplayer-with-physics.git phaser3-example\n\n# Go into the repository\n$ cd phaser3-example\n\n# Install dependencies\n$ npm install\n\n# Start the local development server (on port 3000)\n$ npm run dev\n\n# To publish a production build using docker use docker:publish\n# This needs docker and docker-compose to be installed on your machine\n$ npm run docker:publish\n```\n\n## Other Multiplayer Examples\n\nLooking for a simpler multiplayer example?

[phaser3-multiplayer-example](http://phaser3-multiplayer-example.herokuapp.com/)  \n  _It works best if your latency is below 100ms, which should the case if you are located in Europe._\n\n## Key Features\n\n- The physics is entirely calculated on the Server\n- Automatically manages Rooms (new Phaser instances)\n- Physics debugging version\n- A nice Stats page\n\n## Video\n\nWatch it on YouTube\n\n[![thumbnail](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n8gJQEfA18s/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCpxKgRIHTOZICjxwhdKSrtsIrOJw)](https://youtu.be/n8gJQEfA18s)\n\n## Matter Physics vs Arcade Physics\n\nThis example includes 2 different games. One with MatterJS and the other with Arcade. The MatterJS game has only one level. The Arcade one is a simple platformer game with 3 levels.\n\nSo in total, you can play 4 different levels. For each level, the server creates a new room, which creates a new Phaser instance, which are completely isolated from each other. There can be up to 4 players per room.\n\n## Structure\n\n```bash\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 client  # Contains all the code the client will need\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 physics # This is for debugging the physics (Arcade and MatterJS)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server  # Contains the code running on the NodeJS server\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stats   # The stats page will show useful information about the server\n```\n\n## How To Use\n\nTo clone and run this template, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\n\nYou also need to install some additional packages since this example uses [Node-Canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas). See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling).\n\nFrom your command line:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repository\n$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/yandeu/phaser3-multiplayer-with-physics.git phaser3-example\n\n# Go into the repository\n$ cd phaser3-example\n\n# Install dependencies\n$ npm install\n\n# Start the local development server (on port 3000)\n$ npm run dev\n\n# To publish a production build using docker use docker:publish\n# This needs docker and docker-compose to be installed on your machine\n$ npm run docker:publish\n```\n\n## Other Multiplayer Examples\n\nLooking for a simpler multiplayer example?

The software depends on many libraries that need to be carefully prepared and placed for the building and linking to work properly. \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/UBCMOCCA/TerrainRLSim.git\n```\n\n## Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)\n\n### Install system dependencies\n\nRun the `deb_deps.sh` script to install the system dependencies required to build the project.\n\n\n### OpenGL >= 3.3\n\nEnsure that your machine is capable of running OpenGL version 3.3 or greater.\n\nYou can verify the version of OpenGL your machine currently has installed via the following command:\n```\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\"\n```\n\nIf `glxinfo` is not installed on your system, install the `mesa-utils` package.\n\nOpenGL should come as part of the drivers for your graphics hardware (whether part of the motherboard or dedicated graphics card). If you are missing a compatible version of OpenGL, consider updating your graphics drivers; if you have a GPU, ensure that the system is actually using it.\n\n\n### Build Instructions\n\n1. Download the most recent compressed external file from the [newest release](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepLoco/releases/tag/0.81). \n1. Extract it and move into the TerrainRL directory. The top directory of the TerrainRL repository should now contain a directory called `external`, in addition to all the other directories that were there before.\n1. *If you are using an OS other and Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit* build the source code for caffe that came in the `external` directory.\n\t```\n\tcd external/caffe\n\tmake clean\n\tmake\n\tcd ../../\n\t```\n1. Copy the compiled caffe lib directory from external/caffe/build/lib to the top directory of TerrainRL.\n\t```\n\tcp -r external/caffe/build/lib .\n\t```\n1. Copy other prebuilt libraries from the external folder\n\n\t```\n\tcp external/caffe/build/lib/libcaffe.* lib/\n\tcp external/Bullet/bin/*.so lib/\n\tcp external/jsoncpp/build/debug/src/lib_json/*.so* lib/\n\t```\n1. Generate the python code wrappers (optional, if you are not planning on simulating things from python)\n\t```\n\tcd simAdapter/\n\tsudo apt-get install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip -y\n\t./gen_swig.sh\n\tcd ../\n\t```\n1. Generate makefiles using premake4.\n\t```\n\t./premake4_linux clean\n\t./premake4_linux gmake\n\t```\n1. Build all the targets!\n\t```\n\tcd gmake\n\tmake config=release64\n\tcd ../\n\t```\n\tNote: you can speed up the build by appending the `-j8` flag to this last `make` command, where `8` here is the number of concurrent build threads that `make` will launch. Choose a number that makes sense based on the hardware resources you have available to you.\n\n \n**Note:** There are some issues with the installation on Ubuntu 14.04. Some of the libraries have changed their location and name (see https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/2347 for a solution).\n\n## Windows\n\nThis setup has been tested on Windows 7 and 10 with visual studio 2013.\n\n  1. Download the library.zip file that contains almost all of the relevant pre-compiled external libraries and source code.\n  2. Unpack this library in the same directory the project is located in. For example, TerrainRL/../.\n  3. You might need to install opengl/glu/GL headers. We have been using freeglut for this project. glew might already be included in library.zip.\n  4. You will need to copy some dll files from dynamic_lib.zip to the directory the project is compiled to. For example, optimizer/x64/Debug/. These files are needed by the framework during runtime.\n  5. Might need to create a folder in TerrainRL called \"output\", This is where temporary and current policies will be dumped.\n\n## Running The System\n\nAfter the system has been build there are two executable files that server different purposes. The **TerrainRL** program is for visually simulating the a controller and **TerrainRL_Optimize** is for optimizing the parameters of some controller.\n\nExamples:\n\n\t# To simulate a controller/character  \n\t./TerrainRL -arg_file= args/biped3D/test_biped_3d_args.txt\n\t# To Train a controller\n\t./TerrainRL_Optimizer -arg_file= args/biped3D/opt_train_biped_3d_cacla.txt\n\t./TerrainRL_Optimizer -arg_file= args/genBiped2D/opt_args_imitate_biped_full_phase.txt\n\n## Key Bindings\n\nMost of these are toggles\n\n - c fixed camera mode\n - y draw COM path and contact locations\n - q draw \"filmstrip\" like rendering\n - f draw torques, forces\n - h draw Actor value functions?\n - shift + '>' step one frame\n - p toggle draw value function\n - ',' and '.' change render speed, decrease and increase.\n - \"spacebar\" to pause simulation\n - r restart the scenario\n - l reload the simulation (reparses the arg file)\n - g draw state features\n - x, throw small box\n - z, throw Large box\n - v, disable/enable character shape drawing\n - t, disable/enable recording torques\n - w, rotate sun\n - e, rotate sun (in other diection)\n - W, change sun elevation\n - W, change sun elevation (in other direction)\n - o, CRASH....\n - a, enable/disable record actions\n - j, enable/disable draw info (pos, vel, ect..)\n - k, enable/disable draw kinematic character (mocap poses)\n - m, record motion\n - \"enter\", switch to 3d rendering\n - t, disable/enable training\n\n## Contents of external dependencies folders\nThese lists are provided for reference only. Normally, if you follow the instructions above, you shouldn't need to know about any of this.\n\n### Linux\n - caffe source code (must still be built)\n \t- Specific version (https://github.com/niuzhiheng/caffe.git @ 7b3e6f2341fe7374243ee0126f5cad1fa1e44e14)\n\t - \tIn the instruction to make and build Caffe we uncomment the CPU only line  \n\t\t```\n\t\t# CPU-only switch (uncomment to build without GPU support).\n\t\tCPU_ONLY := 1\n\t\t```\n - BulletPhysics ([This specific threadsafe version](https://github.com/lunkhound/bullet3))\n - [Json_cpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)\n - [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)\n - [CMA-ES](https://github.com/AlexanderFabisch/CMA-ESpp)  \n - [LodePNG](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng)\n\n### Windows\n - Caffe: https://github.com/initialneil/caffe-vs2013\n - TODO: Finish documenting this\n\n# Installing Python Library Version\n\nFollow instructions for building on Linux (Ubuntu)\n 1.  Create a variable for the path to the TerrainRL folder  \n  ```export TERRAINRL_PATH=/path/to/terrainRL``` \n  or\n   ```setenv TERRAINRL_PATH /path/to/terrainRL``` \n   Depending on your shell\n 1.  Run ```pip3 install --user -v -e $TERRAINRL_PATH```\n \n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 23, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "f169efdc09fb5d68c796a027afe423e9721b3ba9 22"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2020-02-14T05:07:45Z", "messageHeadline": "Update requirements.txt", "message": "Update requirements.txt"}}, {"node": {"additions": 76, "author": {"name": "Neo-X"}, "pushedDate": "2020-01-18T19:56:21Z", "messageHeadline": "Working on docker file", "message": "Working on docker file"}}, {"node": {"additions": 102, "author": {"name": "Neo-X"}, "pushedDate": "2020-01-18T19:54:47Z", "messageHeadline": "Working on docker file", "message": "Working on docker file"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Neo-X"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Working on docker file", "message": "Working on docker file"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2020-01-18T00:28:01Z", "messageHeadline": "Create requirements.txt", "message": "Create requirements.txt"}}, {"node": {"additions": 8, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2020-01-17T19:18:11Z", "messageHeadline": "remove sudo", "message": "remove sudo"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2018-10-22T22:13:31Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md\n\nWorking on #7 \r\nUpdating link to proper external libraries."}}, {"node": {"additions": 165, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2018-04-25T22:11:56Z", "messageHeadline": "Create license.txt", "message": "Create license.txt"}}, {"node": {"additions": 26, "author": {"name": "Glen"}, "pushedDate": "2018-04-15T18:13:49Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge pull request #2 from farzadab/master", "message": "Merge pull request #2 from farzadab/master\n\nSmall fixes"}}, {"node": {"additions": 7, "author": {"name": "Farzad Abdolhosseini"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Added python dependencies", "message": "Added python dependencies\n\nThe package requires packages like `numpy` but they weren't explicitly specified."}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Farzad Abdolhosseini"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Fixed formatting", "message": "Fixed formatting\n\nHad messed up formatting in the last commit."}}, {"node": {"additions": 11, "author": {"name": "Farzad Abdolhosseini"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Couple of small fixes to README", "message": "Couple of small fixes to README\n\nHere are the reasons for each fix:\r\n  - git clone link refers to another project;\r\n  - premake4 is available from ubuntu repos, already added to `deb_deps.sh`;\r\n  - Packages `swig3.0`, `python3-dev`, and `python3-pip` are need if one wants to install the Python package, but it's not installed in the `deb_deps.sh` or anywhere else;\r\n  - A lot of the arg files are either not present or broken since the referred files are not present or renamed.

The software depends on many libraries that need to be carefully prepared and placed for the building and linking to work properly. \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/UBCMOCCA/TerrainRLSim.git\n```\n\n## Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)\n\n### Install system dependencies\n\nRun the `deb_deps.sh` script to install the system dependencies required to build the project.\n\n\n### OpenGL >= 3.3\n\nEnsure that your machine is capable of running OpenGL version 3.3 or greater.\n\nYou can verify the version of OpenGL your machine currently has installed via the following command:\n```\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\"\n```\n\nIf `glxinfo` is not installed on your system, install the `mesa-utils` package.\n\nOpenGL should come as part of the drivers for your graphics hardware (whether part of the motherboard or dedicated graphics card). If you are missing a compatible version of OpenGL, consider updating your graphics drivers; if you have a GPU, ensure that the system is actually using it.\n\n\n### Build Instructions\n\n1. Download the most recent compressed external file from the [newest release](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepLoco/releases/tag/0.81). \n1. Extract it and move into the TerrainRL directory. The top directory of the TerrainRL repository should now contain a directory called `external`, in addition to all the other directories that were there before.\n1. *If you are using an OS other and Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit* build the source code for caffe that came in the `external` directory.\n\t```\n\tcd external/caffe\n\tmake clean\n\tmake\n\tcd ../../\n\t```\n1. Copy the compiled caffe lib directory from external/caffe/build/lib to the top directory of TerrainRL.\n\t```\n\tcp -r external/caffe/build/lib .\n\t```\n1. Copy other prebuilt libraries from the external folder\n\n\t```\n\tcp external/caffe/build/lib/libcaffe.* lib/\n\tcp external/Bullet/bin/*.so lib/\n\tcp external/jsoncpp/build/debug/src/lib_json/*.so* lib/\n\t```\n1. Generate the python code wrappers (optional, if you are not planning on simulating things from python)\n\t```\n\tcd simAdapter/\n\tsudo apt-get install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip -y\n\t./gen_swig.sh\n\tcd ../\n\t```\n1. Generate makefiles using premake4.\n\t```\n\t./premake4_linux clean\n\t./premake4_linux gmake\n\t```\n1. Build all the targets!\n\t```\n\tcd gmake\n\tmake config=release64\n\tcd ../\n\t```\n\tNote: you can speed up the build by appending the `-j8` flag to this last `make` command, where `8` here is the number of concurrent build threads that `make` will launch. Choose a number that makes sense based on the hardware resources you have available to you.\n\n \n**Note:** There are some issues with the installation on Ubuntu 14.04. Some of the libraries have changed their location and name (see https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/2347 for a solution).\n\n## Windows\n\nThis setup has been tested on Windows 7 and 10 with visual studio 2013.\n\n  1. Download the library.zip file that contains almost all of the relevant pre-compiled external libraries and source code.\n  2. Unpack this library in the same directory the project is located in. For example, TerrainRL/../.\n  3. You might need to install opengl/glu/GL headers. We have been using freeglut for this project. glew might already be included in library.zip.\n  4. You will need to copy some dll files from dynamic_lib.zip to the directory the project is compiled to. For example, optimizer/x64/Debug/. These files are needed by the framework during runtime.\n  5. Might need to create a folder in TerrainRL called \"output\", This is where temporary and current policies will be dumped.\n\n## Running The System\n\nAfter the system has been build there are two executable files that server different purposes. The **TerrainRL** program is for visually simulating the a controller and **TerrainRL_Optimize** is for optimizing the parameters of some controller.\n\nExamples:\n\n\t# To simulate a controller/character  \n\t./TerrainRL -arg_file= args/biped3D/test_biped_3d_args.txt\n\t# To Train a controller\n\t./TerrainRL_Optimizer -arg_file= args/biped3D/opt_train_biped_3d_cacla.txt\n\t./TerrainRL_Optimizer -arg_file= args/genBiped2D/opt_args_imitate_biped_full_phase.txt\n\n## Key Bindings\n\nMost of these are toggles\n\n - c fixed camera mode\n - y draw COM path and contact locations\n - q draw \"filmstrip\" like rendering\n - f draw torques, forces\n - h draw Actor value functions?\n - shift + '>' step one frame\n - p toggle draw value function\n - ',' and '.' change render speed, decrease and increase.\n - \"spacebar\" to pause simulation\n - r restart the scenario\n - l reload the simulation (reparses the arg file)\n - g draw state features\n - x, throw small box\n - z, throw Large box\n - v, disable/enable character shape drawing\n - t, disable/enable recording torques\n - w, rotate sun\n - e, rotate sun (in other diection)\n - W, change sun elevation\n - W, change sun elevation (in other direction)\n - o, CRASH....\n - a, enable/disable record actions\n - j, enable/disable draw info (pos, vel, ect..)\n - k, enable/disable draw kinematic character (mocap poses)\n - m, record motion\n - \"enter\", switch to 3d rendering\n - t, disable/enable training\n\n## Contents of external dependencies folders\nThese lists are provided for reference only. Normally, if you follow the instructions above, you shouldn't need to know about any of this.\n\n### Linux\n - caffe source code (must still be built)\n \t- Specific version (https://github.com/niuzhiheng/caffe.git @ 7b3e6f2341fe7374243ee0126f5cad1fa1e44e14)\n\t - \tIn the instruction to make and build Caffe we uncomment the CPU only line  \n\t\t```\n\t\t# CPU-only switch (uncomment to build without GPU support).\n\t\tCPU_ONLY := 1\n\t\t```\n - BulletPhysics ([This specific threadsafe version](https://github.com/lunkhound/bullet3))\n - [Json_cpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)\n - [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)\n - [CMA-ES](https://github.com/AlexanderFabisch/CMA-ESpp)  \n - [LodePNG](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng)\n\n### Windows\n - Caffe: https://github.com/initialneil/caffe-vs2013\n - TODO: Finish documenting this\n\n# Installing Python Library Version\n\nFollow instructions for building on Linux (Ubuntu)\n 1.  Create a variable for the path to the TerrainRL folder  \n  ```export TERRAINRL_PATH=/path/to/terrainRL``` \n  or\n   ```setenv TERRAINRL_PATH /path/to/terrainRL``` \n   Depending on your shell\n 1.  Run ```pip3 install --user -v -e $TERRAINRL_PATH```\n \n"}, "Jaime5/FlipItPhysics-Physics2": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Jaime5/FlipItPhysics-Physics2", "diskUsage": 6702, "name": "FlipItPhysics-Physics2", "owner": {"login": "Jaime5"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2015-12-23T10:30:30Z", "pushedAt": "2017-02-04T04:55:08Z", "object": {"text": "# FlipItPhysics: Answers for Thermodynamics, and Electrity & Magnetism\n\nThe answers to the thermodynamics section is difficult to\nfind, so I decided to provide my solution set and worked out\nexamples in python code.

To do so, you will need to find an appropriate gravity constant and assign GRAVITY to that number (line 17). Because of the way the Y axis works in Python Arcade, GRAVITY will need to be a negative number for the balls to fall.\n\nYou will then need to accelerate the balls according to the GRAVITY constant. You can call b.accelerate(x,y) on line 67. In the case of applying gravity, x will be 0 and y will be GRAVITY.\n\n*main2.py*, is a little more complicated. You will need to apply all the lessons you learned in main1.py, but now we want the balls to bounce off the walls. First apply the GRAVITY constant from main1.py and accelerate the balls. Then, lines 39, 45, 51, and 57 will ask you to bounce (reverse the velocity) of the ball when it hits a wall. Think about what we discussed in class. I am applying some friction so they don't bounce forever. *I added a margin to the wall to handle fast-moving balls. SCREENWIDTH - MARGIN would represent the right side of the window, for example.*\n\n*main3.py* is an opportunity for you to implement elastic collisions using the conservation of momentum.

The process will however look very similar with other distributions, the main differences being the package manager and library package names.\n\nFirst, install a few pre-requisites:\n\n`sudo apt-get install cmake g++ git python3-dev qt5-qmake qt5-default`\n\nThen, change to the directory to install the source code in, and obtain the current sources from the repository (or alternatively download and extract a source code package)\n\n`cd <gitdir>`\n\nTo build the project using CMake, set up a build directory and choose the build options (explanation)\n\n`mkdir mantaflow/build`\n\n`cd mantaflow/build`\n\n`cmake .. -DGUI=ON -DOPENMP=ON -DNUMPY=ON -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.6`\n\n`make -j4`\n\nThat's it! You can now test mantaflow using an example scene\n\n`./manta ../scenes/examples/simpleplume.py`\n\nCommon Linux problems:\n\n- In conjunction with tensorflow, it can easily happen these days that you have multiple version of python installed. If cmake for mantaflow finds a different one than you're using for tensorflow, you will get errors such as ''ImportError: no module named XXX''. To fix this problem, manually select a python version in cmake with -DPYTHON_VERSION=X.Y\n- It is also possible to directly specify the directory in which the python installation resides as follows:\n    - `DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/PATH/TO/PYTHONENV/include/python3.6m `\n    - `DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/PATH/TO/PYTHONENV/lib/libpython3.6m.so`\n\nFurther information on the installation process can be found on the project website http://mantaflow.com/.\n\n\n### Setup TensorFlow\n\nThe code was created and tested with TensorFlow 1.7.0, CUDA V9.0.176, CUDNN 7.0.5 and Keras 2.1.6.\nIf errors arise make sure your installation is correct.\n\nAfter checking your installation install the following packages:\n\n`pip install tensorflow-gpu keras numpy sklearn imageio scipy matplotlib h5py`\n\n\n### Generate Dataset\n\nIn this example we generate a simple 2D dataset in the resolution 64. To make things more interesting we actually generate a 128 simulation and downsample the fields accordingly. In the following we present the commands needed to train the `total_pressure` model that predicts future pressure fields. \n\nMake sure you are in the *\\<gitdir\\>/mantaflow/* directory.\n\n`cd <gitdir>/mantaflow/`\n\n`./build/manta scenes/dpfn_dataset.py --name=2D_liquid64 --dimension 2 --type liquid -n 1000 -s 100 -w 50 --seed 10 --resolution 128 --zoom 0.5`\n\nThe resulting dataset is stored in the *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/* directory. You can even supervise the simulation process by adding *--gui* to the command. This only works when Mantaflow is installed with QT support.\n\nAfter the generation process finished the dataset properties should be evaluated using the following commands: \n\n`cd ../src`\n\n`python -m dataset.dataset_properties --dataset ../datasets/2D_liquid64/ --chunk_size 20`\n\nDepending on the available RAM the *chunk_size* setting should be adjusted.\n\nAfterwards a *properties.json* should be placed in the  *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/* directory containing a large listing of different properties of the data.\nFor the total pressure prediction approach, the value in `[\"pressure\"][\"Percentile99_9\"][\"Total\"]` is the most important one.\nWrite this value down since it is later used to normalize your input data. In our example case the value is `~3.8`.\n\nNow the training data was generated successfully and we already have the normalization value for the quantity in question, the total pressure field.\n\n\n### Train the Autoencoder\n\n`cd <gitdir>/src`\n\nAdjust the *settings.json* if your pressure percentile value is different from 3.8.\nTo do so edit the value in `[\"dataset\"][\"pressure_normalization_factor\"]`.\nIf needed also adjust the batch size of the autoencoder training by changing `[\"ae\"][\"batch_size\"]` accordingly.\n\nTo train only the autoencoder model execute the following command in the *\\<gitdir\\>/src/* directory:\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 40 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 0 --chunk_size 20 --ae_evaluate --ae_loss mse`\n\nNote that `train_total.py` is the python script needed to train the `total_pressure` model. If the model should predict velocity fields instead, `train_vel.py` needs to be called accordingly.\n\nAfter the training process the final autoencoder model should reside under the given name *total_2D_liquid64* in the projects directory *\\<gitdir\\>/projects/*.\nThe images with name scheme *AE_EncDec_{Number}.png* display a direct comparison of the Ground Truth to the encoded and then directly decoded autoencoder version.\nThe images starting with *Pressure_Eval_Plot_{Number}.png* all show the same Ground Truth but evaluated after each epoch to track the training progress.\n\nIf the results look good enough we can now move on to training the prediction network.\n\n\n### Train the Prediction Network\n\nTo train the prediction network we specify to load the previously generated autoencoder model in project *total_2D_liquid64* without training it *ae_epochs = 0*. At first we specify to train only one lstm epoch. This is done due to the sequence training data generation taking place before the actual training process. \nThe results are stored in the specified dataset directory *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/encoded_total_pressure.npz* and *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure{_normalized}.png*.\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 0 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 1 --chunk_size 20 --ae_loss mse --ae_load total_2D_liquid64`\n\nBefore training the prediction network make sure to select a good normalization factor so that the *enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure_normalized.png* is in the range *[-1,1]* by adjusting the `[\"dataset\"][\"pressure_encoded_total_normalization_factor\"]` in the *settings.json* to a more fitting value.\nThe *enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure_normalized.png* is re-created on every execution of the following call:\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 0 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 50 --chunk_size 20 --lstm_evaluate 5 --ae_loss mse --ae_load total_2D_liquid64 --lstm_load_dataset`\n\nAfter the training is finished the *lstm.h5* model is placed in the projects directory *\\<gitdir\\>/projects/total_2D_liquid64/*.\n\n\n### Evaluate the Results\n\nTo use the prediction network in a simulation environment the *dpfn_prediction.py* script is used. It is implemented as a Mantaflow scene and therefore it is necessary to switch to the mantaflow directory.\n\n`cd <gitdir>/mantaflow`\n\nTo finally execute one of the benchmark scenes with the trained models the following command is used:\n\n`./build/manta scenes/dpfn_prediction.py --name=\"total_2D_liquid64\" --project=\"total_2D_liquid64\" -w 50  -s 100 -i 5 -pt total_pressure --benchmark 1`\n\nThe parameter *name* stands for the name of the output directory in the *\\<gitdir\\>/predictions/* folder.\nResulting in a final path of *\\<gitdir\\>/predictions/total_2D_liquid64_Bench1/*.\nThe parameters *w*, *s*, *i* stand for the warmup steps, the simulation steps that are executed after the warmup phase and the prediction interval as described in the paper, respectively.\n*-pt total_pressure* sets the prediction mode to the total pressure approach. This needs to match the mode of the trained model.\n\n\n## Trained Model and Simulation Data\n\nThe following links lead to a trained version of the Total Pressure Autoencoder as well as the trained LSTM Prediction network and two liquid datasets (small/large). The large dataset was used to train the networks.\nAfter unpacking, the datasets must be copied to the `<gitdir>/datasets` directory whereas the network models must be copied to the `<gitdir>/projects` directory.\n\n### Downloads\n- [Total Pressure Model](http://ge.in.tum.de/download/2018-wiewel/2D_liquid64_trained.tar.gz)\n- [Small Simulation Dataset (10 scenes with 100 frames

This only works when Mantaflow is installed with QT support.\n\nAfter the generation process finished the dataset properties should be evaluated using the following commands: \n\n`cd ../src`\n\n`python -m dataset.dataset_properties --dataset ../datasets/2D_liquid64/ --chunk_size 20`\n\nDepending on the available RAM the *chunk_size* setting should be adjusted.\n\nAfterwards a *properties.json* should be placed in the  *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/* directory containing a large listing of different properties of the data.\nFor the total pressure prediction approach, the value in `[\"pressure\"][\"Percentile99_9\"][\"Total\"]` is the most important one.\nWrite this value down since it is later used to normalize your input data. In our example case the value is `~3.8`.\n\nNow the training data was generated successfully and we already have the normalization value for the quantity in question, the total pressure field.\n\n\n### Train the Autoencoder\n\n`cd <gitdir>/src`\n\nAdjust the *settings.json* if your pressure percentile value is different from 3.8.\nTo do so edit the value in `[\"dataset\"][\"pressure_normalization_factor\"]`.\nIf needed also adjust the batch size of the autoencoder training by changing `[\"ae\"][\"batch_size\"]` accordingly.\n\nTo train only the autoencoder model execute the following command in the *\\<gitdir\\>/src/* directory:\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 40 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 0 --chunk_size 20 --ae_evaluate --ae_loss mse`\n\nNote that `train_total.py` is the python script needed to train the `total_pressure` model. If the model should predict velocity fields instead, `train_vel.py` needs to be called accordingly.\n\nAfter the training process the final autoencoder model should reside under the given name *total_2D_liquid64* in the projects directory *\\<gitdir\\>/projects/*.\nThe images with name scheme *AE_EncDec_{Number}.png* display a direct comparison of the Ground Truth to the encoded and then directly decoded autoencoder version.\nThe images starting with *Pressure_Eval_Plot_{Number}.png* all show the same Ground Truth but evaluated after each epoch to track the training progress.\n\nIf the results look good enough we can now move on to training the prediction network.\n\n\n### Train the Prediction Network\n\nTo train the prediction network we specify to load the previously generated autoencoder model in project *total_2D_liquid64* without training it *ae_epochs = 0*. At first we specify to train only one lstm epoch. This is done due to the sequence training data generation taking place before the actual training process. \nThe results are stored in the specified dataset directory *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/encoded_total_pressure.npz* and *\\<gitdir\\>/datasets/2D_liquid64/enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure{_normalized}.png*.\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 0 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 1 --chunk_size 20 --ae_loss mse --ae_load total_2D_liquid64`\n\nBefore training the prediction network make sure to select a good normalization factor so that the *enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure_normalized.png* is in the range *[-1,1]* by adjusting the `[\"dataset\"][\"pressure_encoded_total_normalization_factor\"]` in the *settings.json* to a more fitting value.\nThe *enc_scene_list_encoded_total_pressure_normalized.png* is re-created on every execution of the following call:\n\n`python train_total.py --name total_2D_liquid64 --dataset 2D_liquid64 --ae_epochs 0 --ae_pretrainepochs 0 --lstm_epochs 50 --chunk_size 20 --lstm_evaluate 5 --ae_loss mse --ae_load total_2D_liquid64 --lstm_load_dataset`\n\nAfter the training is finished the *lstm.h5* model is placed in the projects directory *\\<gitdir\\>/projects/total_2D_liquid64/*.\n\n\n### Evaluate the Results\n\nTo use the prediction network in a simulation environment the *dpfn_prediction.py* script is used. It is implemented as a Mantaflow scene and therefore it is necessary to switch to the mantaflow directory.\n\n`cd <gitdir>/mantaflow`\n\nTo finally execute one of the benchmark scenes with the trained models the following command is used:\n\n`./build/manta scenes/dpfn_prediction.py --name=\"total_2D_liquid64\" --project=\"total_2D_liquid64\" -w 50  -s 100 -i 5 -pt total_pressure --benchmark 1`\n\nThe parameter *name* stands for the name of the output directory in the *\\<gitdir\\>/predictions/* folder.\nResulting in a final path of *\\<gitdir\\>/predictions/total_2D_liquid64_Bench1/*.\nThe parameters *w*, *s*, *i* stand for the warmup steps, the simulation steps that are executed after the warmup phase and the prediction interval as described in the paper, respectively.\n*-pt total_pressure* sets the prediction mode to the total pressure approach. This needs to match the mode of the trained model.\n\n\n## Trained Model and Simulation Data\n\nThe following links lead to a trained version of the Total Pressure Autoencoder as well as the trained LSTM Prediction network and two liquid datasets (small/large). The large dataset was used to train the networks.\nAfter unpacking, the datasets must be copied to the `<gitdir>/datasets` directory whereas the network models must be copied to the `<gitdir>/projects` directory.\n\n### Downloads\n- [Total Pressure Model](http://ge.in.tum.de/download/2018-wiewel/2D_liquid64_trained.tar.gz)\n- [Small Simulation Dataset (10 scenes with 100 frames

this?\n\nA simple physics simulation/meditation/relaxation experiment. Which you can view [here](http://andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/tumbler)\n\n### Why?\n\nUltimately the main motivating factor for this experiment was my desire to learn a bunch of \"new\" technologies:\n\n* [Box2dWeb](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/) - Rather than roll my own physics I decided to finally take the plunge and learn how to use a real physics engine.\n* SVG - Most of my prior experiments were built using Canvas or DOM rendering. This turned out to be a good chance to try out SVG.\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - 99.9% of my coding at work is in JS. I was curious what all the hubbub was about.\n* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) - As a last minute decision, I decided it would be nice to play with something entirely new.\n\nWhat came out of the combination of the above is something that I find myself staring at for unexpectedly long periods of time.\n\n### Reference Links:\n\n* [iforce 2d - Box2d C++ tutorials](http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/)\n* [Box2d Flash API Docs](http://www.box2dflash.org/docs/2.1a/reference/)\n* [HTML5 Rocks - Getting Started with Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)\n* [HTML5 Rocks - Developing Game Audio with the Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/games/)\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n* [Freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/)\n    * All sounds are from the the [glockenspiel pack](http://www.freesound.org/people/pmedig/packs/10341/) by [pmedig](http://www.freesound.org/people/pmedig/)\n\n### Building\n\n1. Run `npm install`.\n2. `grunt`.\n3. In another terminal run a server to serve this projects directory (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`).\n4.

Which you can view [here](http://andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/tumbler)\n\n### Why?\n\nUltimately the main motivating factor for this experiment was my desire to learn a bunch of \"new\" technologies:\n\n* [Box2dWeb](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/) - Rather than roll my own physics I decided to finally take the plunge and learn how to use a real physics engine.\n* SVG - Most of my prior experiments were built using Canvas or DOM rendering. This turned out to be a good chance to try out SVG.\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - 99.9% of my coding at work is in JS. I was curious what all the hubbub was about.\n* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) - As a last minute decision, I decided it would be nice to play with something entirely new.\n\nWhat came out of the combination of the above is something that I find myself staring at for unexpectedly long periods of time.\n\n### Reference Links:\n\n* [iforce 2d - Box2d C++ tutorials](http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/)\n* [Box2d Flash API Docs](http://www.box2dflash.org/docs/2.1a/reference/)\n* [HTML5 Rocks - Getting Started with Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)\n* [HTML5 Rocks - Developing Game Audio with the Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/games/)\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n* [Freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/)\n    * All sounds are from the the [glockenspiel pack](http://www.freesound.org/people/pmedig/packs/10341/) by [pmedig](http://www.freesound.org/people/pmedig/)\n\n### Building\n\n1.

Now I only wrapped matplotlib plotting library, implemented simple regression, easy file input, and `docx` generation. To simplify repetious works. \n\nThis project comes with NO WARRENTY.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n**Install the package**\n\n Use TUNA mirror to accelerate. Depencencies like numpy and matplotlib will be installed automatically. \n\n```\npip install -i https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple physicsexp\n```\n\n**Test the installation(Optional)**\n\n```\n>>> from physicsexp.mainfunc import *\n>>> from physicsexp.gendocx import *\n>>>\n```\n\nIf no error then you are ready! If error occurs feel free to open an issue.\n\n**Run the example script(Recommended)**\n\n```\npython3 ./physicsexp/example/plot.py\n```\n\nYou'll see graphs poped out and saved to .png, a generated gen.docx ready to print, and calculations printed to output, in the `./physicsexp/example` directory. You can also clone USTCPhysExpData to try some real-life cases. Then you can modify the code or write your own code to process your data!\n\n## Example Script Explained\n\nIt is a real-case example of input several lines of data, plot the data and do linear regression, and generate a printable docx document containing plot and analyse results. \n\nIf you really want to know, the experiment is about verifying the relativistic kinetic energy vs. momentum relationship of electron(beta-ray) and measuring the extraction of beta-ray by aluminum pieces of different thickness. \n\n**First, put your data in `data.txt`**, like this:\n\n```\n# \u4f4d\u7f6ex\ne -2\n23.     24.2    25.5    26.5    27.7    29.     30.5    31.8\n# \u5cf0\u4f4dN\n245.77  291.79  336.40  378.52  417.94  456.14  510.12  544.95\n# \u94dd\u7247\u6570\u91cfM\n0       1       2       3       4       5\n# \u9009\u533a\u8ba1\u6570N\n43901   34258   28725   23670   19386   16866\n```\n\nYou can use `#` to comment a line, and `e *` to specify the order of magnitude. \n\n**Then it's time to write python**\n\nHeaders & imports\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom physicsexp.mainfunc import *\nfrom physicsexp.gendocx import *\n```\n\nRead the file easily with the `readoneline` function\n\n```python\nfin = open('./data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')\npos = readoneline(fin)\nN = readoneline(fin)\nAl_num = readoneline(fin)\nCnt = readoneline(fin)\nfin.close()\n```\n\nCalculate and print some results. This is python, you can do whatever you like easily.

Especially `physicsexp/mainfunc.py` and `physicsexp/gendocx.py`. \n\n- Or open an issue. If you are also a USTC student just contact me with QQ/Email. Contacts are on my website. \n\nBut don't be frustrated if none of these works. \n\n**And can using these tools boost your efficiency? I don't know, but probably can't.**\n\n**Finally, think twice before wasting time on this project, instead, enjoy your life, learn some real physics, and find a (boy|girl)friend.**\n\n## Misc Information\n\n[Here](./misc.md).

Now I only wrapped matplotlib plotting library, implemented simple regression, easy file input, and `docx` generation. To simplify repetious works. \n\nThis project comes with NO WARRENTY.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n**Install the package**\n\n Use TUNA mirror to accelerate. Depencencies like numpy and matplotlib will be installed automatically. \n\n```\npip install -i https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple physicsexp\n```\n\n**Test the installation(Optional)**\n\n```\n>>> from physicsexp.mainfunc import *\n>>> from physicsexp.gendocx import *\n>>>\n```\n\nIf no error then you are ready! If error occurs feel free to open an issue.\n\n**Run the example script(Recommended)**\n\n```\npython3 ./physicsexp/example/plot.py\n```\n\nYou'll see graphs poped out and saved to .png, a generated gen.docx ready to print, and calculations printed to output, in the `./physicsexp/example` directory. You can also clone USTCPhysExpData to try some real-life cases. Then you can modify the code or write your own code to process your data!\n\n## Example Script Explained\n\nIt is a real-case example of input several lines of data, plot the data and do linear regression, and generate a printable docx document containing plot and analyse results. \n\nIf you really want to know, the experiment is about verifying the relativistic kinetic energy vs. momentum relationship of electron(beta-ray) and measuring the extraction of beta-ray by aluminum pieces of different thickness. \n\n**First, put your data in `data.txt`**, like this:\n\n```\n# \u4f4d\u7f6ex\ne -2\n23.     24.2    25.5    26.5    27.7    29.     30.5    31.8\n# \u5cf0\u4f4dN\n245.77  291.79  336.40  378.52  417.94  456.14  510.12  544.95\n# \u94dd\u7247\u6570\u91cfM\n0       1       2       3       4       5\n# \u9009\u533a\u8ba1\u6570N\n43901   34258   28725   23670   19386   16866\n```\n\nYou can use `#` to comment a line, and `e *` to specify the order of magnitude. \n\n**Then it's time to write python**\n\nHeaders & imports\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom physicsexp.mainfunc import *\nfrom physicsexp.gendocx import *\n```\n\nRead the file easily with the `readoneline` function\n\n```python\nfin = open('./data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')\npos = readoneline(fin)\nN = readoneline(fin)\nAl_num = readoneline(fin)\nCnt = readoneline(fin)\nfin.close()\n```\n\nCalculate and print some results. This is python, you can do whatever you like easily. (This part is not related to the library, you can skip this)\n\n```python\na = 2.373e-3\nb = -.0161\ndEk = .20\n\nc0 = 299792458.\nMeV = 1e6 * electron\n\nEmeasure = a * N + b + dEk\nx0 = .10\nR = (pos - x0) / 2\nB = 640.01e-4\nMomentum = 300 * B * R\nEclassic = ((Momentum * MeV)**2 / (2 * me * c0**2)) / MeV\nErela = np.array([math.sqrt((i * MeV)**2 + (me * c0**2)**2) - me * c0**2 for i in Momentum]) / MeV\nprint('pos\\t', pos)\nprint('R\\t', R*100)\nprint('pc\\t', Momentum)\nprint('N\\t', N)\nprint('Eclas\\t', Eclassic)\nprint('Erela\\t', Erela)\nprint('Emes\\t', Emeasure)\n```\n\n**Now, plot!**\n\nFirst graph: three curve in one figure. Using `simple_plot`. You can use LaTeX in plot labels. Graph is saved to `1.png`. Use `show=0` to plot multiple lines on one figure. \n\n```python\nsimple_plot(Momentum, Emeasure, show=0, issetrange=0, dot='+', lab='\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u80fd')\nsimple_plot(Momentum, Eclassic, show=0, issetrange=0, dot='*', lab='\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u80fd')\nsimple_plot(Momentum, Erela, dot='o', save='1.png', issetrange=0, xlab='$pc/MeV$', ylab='$E/MeV$', title='\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u80fd\u968f\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u66f2\u7ebf', lab='\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u52a8\u80fd')\n```\n\nSecond graph, a simple curve, saved to `2.png`:\n\n```python\nLen = 150\nCnt = Cnt / Len\nsimple_plot(Al_num, Cnt, xlab='\u94dd\u7247\u6570', ylab='\u9009\u533a\u8ba1\u6570\u7387(\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6)', title='$\\\\beta$\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968f\u94dd\u7247\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u66f2\u7ebf', save='2.png')\n```\n\nThird graph, a curve with a linear fit, using `simple_linear_plot`, saved to `3.png`:\n\n```python\nCntLn = np.log(Cnt)\nd = 50\nAl_Real = Al_num * d\nslope, intercept = simple_linear_plot(Al_Real, CntLn, xlab='\u8d28\u91cf\u539a\u5ea6$g/cm^{-2}$', ylab='\u9009\u533a\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u5bf9\u6570(\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5ea6)', title='\u534a\u5bf9\u6570\u66f2\u7ebf\u66f2\u7ebf', save='3.png')\nprint(-slope)\nprint(math.log(1e4) / (-slope))\nprint((math.log(Cnt[0]) - 4 * math.log(10) - intercept) / slope)\n```\n\n**Don't bother putting pictures in documents yourself!**\n\nWith a single line of code, generate a printable docx document with the above three pictures and the fit results. \n\n```python\ngendocx('gen.docx', '1.png', '2.png', '3.png', 'slope, intercept: %f %f' % (slope, intercept))\n```\n\n**Results**\n\nOutput:\n\n```\npos\t [0.23  0.242 0.255 0.265 0.277 0.29  0.305 0.318]\nR\t [ 6.5   7.1   7.75  8.25  8.85  9.5  10.25 10.9 ]\npc\t [1.2480195  1.3632213  1.48802325 1.58402475 1.69922655 1.8240285\n 1.96803075 2.0928327 ]\nN\t [245.77 291.79 336.4  378.52 417.94 456.14 510.12 544.95]\nEclas\t [1.52375616 1.81804848 2.16616816 2.45469003 2.82471934 3.25488743\n 3.78910372 4.28491053]\nErela\t [0.83752628 0.94478965 1.0622588  1.15334615 1.26333503 1.3831891\n 1.52222218 1.64324566]\nEmes\t [0.76711221 0.87631767 0.9821772  1.08212796 1.17567162 1.26632022\n 1.39441476 1.47706635]\n0.0038199159787357996\n2411.136900195471\n2402.45428200782\n```\n\nGenerated docx: \n\n![](./physicsexp/example/gen.png)\n\nDon't forget to change my name to yours. \n\n## Detailed Usage\n\nWanna know how to use after reading the example? \n\nYou can: \n\n- Have a look at my programs in USTCPhysExpData.\n > However, they are not intended to run directly on your machine and magically give you correct answer without any change, but, if you really want to run them, maybe a `git reset` on this repository and dive into the dark history is the last resort. \n\n- Read the source code yourself. Especially `physicsexp/mainfunc.py` and `physicsexp/gendocx.py`. \n\n- Or open an issue. If you are also a USTC student just contact me with QQ/Email. Contacts are on my website. \n\nBut don't be frustrated if none of these works. \n\n**And can using these tools boost your efficiency? I don't know, but probably can't.**\n\n**Finally, think twice before wasting time on this project, instead, enjoy your life, learn some real physics, and find a (boy|girl)friend.**\n\n## Misc Information\n\n[Here](./misc.md).

I hope this more modular approach will allow designers to build a larger variety of vehicle types.\n\n## Car Physics (CP)\nFor the best results (but please consider the performance costs) it is advised to change the Unity default physics settings to the following:\n\n**Physics** (Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics)\nDefault Solver Iterations: 12\nDefault Solver Velocity Iterations: 12\n\n**Time** (Edit -> Project Settings -> Time)\nFixed Timestep = 0.01666667 (60Hz)\n\n### CpMain\nThis is the main hub for the state and data about the vehicle. All the other components reference and update it.\n\n### CpInput\nGets the acceleration and steeting inputs from the player. Abilities check for their own inputs which is not ideal but it is done for simplicity.\n\nTODO:\n1. Make sure that all inputs are handled from within CpInput. Abilities should register themselves to CpInput when added to the vehicle and deregister when removed.\n\n### CpAcceleration\nThis script contains two approaches to applying acceleration to the vehicle, and also calculates the speed data of the vehicle. You're welcome to use whichever approach best suits your workflow or project. \n\nThe first approach scales of the applied force, depending on the current velocity of the vehicle. This is simpler to implement, but less intuitive to design for unless you are well aquainted with physics. \n\nThe second approach uses a Velocity-Time curve to calculate what force should be applied. This is more complicated to calculate, but far more designer friendly. The goal of this project is to be more design-centric, so I prefer this approach. It is outlined in the Skylanders GDC talk mentioned above, but here are the steps: \n\nThe Process works using reverse evaluation of the given Velocity-Time [AnimationCurve](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AnimationCurve.html).\n1. Binary search using current forward speed to find the time value on the graph.\n2. Add one time step onto that time value and evaluate the graph to get the new velocity.\n3. Calculate a = (Vf - Vi)/deltaTime\n4. Return the new force to apply (Must use ForceMode.Acceleration to ignore mass)\n\nThe designer only has to create a Vel-Time graph which outlines the behaviour they want out of the vehicle, eg. they can set the Animation Curve to go from 0 - 100km in 5 seconds and that is exactly how it will respond.\n\nNOTE: To be able to reverse it has to be factored into the Velocity-Time graph.\n\n### CpTurning\nTurning is implemented by applying a Torque to the Rigidbody around the Y-Axis. The torque is applied using `Forcemode.VelocityChange` so that angular velocity is affected directly, and the mass is ignored.\n\nA speed factor is applied to the turning force so that the vehicle cannot turn at full force if it is standing still. An offset can be added to this speed factor to adjust how quickly the max turn force is achieved.\n\nTODO: \n1. Use an AnimationCurve to scale torque so that the designer has more visual control.\n2. Test implementation of the Vel-Force curve mentioned in the CP_Acceleration component\n\n### CpColliderData\nUses the colliders of the vehicle to determine the average normal of the surface the vehicle is on.\n\nThis is useful for:\n* applying angular stability forces. \n* checking if the vehicle is on the ground but not on its wheels. \n\n### CpDrag\nAdjusts the drag and angular drag of the vehicles rigidbody. The drag values can easily be adjusted depending on various scenarios.\n\n**NOTE:** The collider physics material used has no friction and so currently, drag is the force that slows the vehicle down.\n\n### CpLateralFriction\n*Implemented based on understanding of the Rocket League Talk.*\n\nLateral friction is how much the tyres will slip sideways. This implementation is simple and aims to give the player good control while driving, but some skid when it comes to land at an angle. Otherwise it can be quite jarring if the car stops dead.\n\nWhen grounded, the side speed is calculated and the force required to cancel that movement is applied as an `Forcemode.Impulse`.\n\nTo make the vehicle slide more or less, the designer can adjust the base tyre stickiness. \n* 0 - The tyres have no grip\n* 1 - The tyres stick perfectly\n\n**NOTE:** Currently, at very high speeds this functionality does not work correctly.\n\nTODO: \n1. Apply surface normal factor to the lateral friction calculations so that the tyres are more slippery on angled surfaces\n\n### CpStabilityForces\n*Implemented based on understanding of the Rocket League Talk.*\n\nThe player loses some degree of control when the vehicle is airborn or rolling. The stability forces are used to get the vehicle into a controllable state as soon as possible. \n\n**\"Linear\" Stability**\n* Applied when between 1 and 3 tyres are grounded.\n* Applies a downward force from each wheel position. \n* Snaps the wheels down to the ground so that the player can be in control again as soon as possible.\n\n![LinearStability](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/LinearStability.gif)\n\n**\"Angular\" Stability**\n* Only applied when the vehicle colliders are in contact with the ground but the wheels aren't grounded\n* Calculates the angle between the AverageSurfaceNormal and the Vehicles local up direction\n* Applies a roll torque to try to align the car Up with the surface normal to get the car back onto it's wheels.\n\nThe angular stability only calculates the roll torque as trying to stabilise multiple axis can be unpredictable. -Rocket League Talk\n\n![AngularStability](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/AngularStability.gif)\n\n### CpWheels\nKeeps a list of the physics wheel transforms.\nEach wheel raycasts downward in order to get the surface normal and whether the wheel is grounded or not.\n\nAt this point in time the height of the physics rig is set by a pair of capsule colliders. This is definitely a weakness in the framework and needs some iteration.\n\nTODO:\n1. Experiment with using physics based suspension but need to determine the trade off between control and being able to handle wheel collisions more accurately\n2. Look into using [Physics.ComputePenetration](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.ComputePenetration.html) to handle collisions with sub suspension height objects. Similar to how it is handled in the Unchartered 4x4 talk.\n\n## Car Visuals (CV)\nWhile researching various approaches to building vehicle systems, I found that the general consensus is that it is better to seperate the phyiscs rig from that of the visual rig.\n\n**Pros**\n* Less parameter tuning\n* More consistent control and more accessible\n* Quicker iteration time on visual changes\n* Can fake the physics reactions so that most players wouldnt notice\n\n**Cons**\n* Loss of procedural, more reactive animation\n* Have to maintain seperate physics and visual rig\n\n### CvWheels\nControls where the wheel models are placed and the tire particles\n\n### CvBodyMovement\nFakes the effect of momentum/intertia on the car. It rolls the vehicle's body depending on the side speed/steering input and pitches it depending on the accel input and forward speed.\n\nCan easily tweak the amount of angle from the input and speed.\n\n## Camera System - Cinemachine-based system\nThe camera system is quite basic at the moment. There are two virtual cameras, one follows the vehicle from behind while grounded and focuses slightly ahead of where the vehicle is heading. The second follows the player in air, and focuses in the direction of movement. It does not rotate, so that if the vehicle is spinning in the air the camera remains stable and manageable.\n\n![PanningIn](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/PanningIn.gif)\n\n## Car Abilities (CA)\nNow that the Physics and Visual rigs have been discussed (and set up on your side), it is time to give the vehicle some abilities. I mean, it is for a video game after all... \n\nStill experimenting with the best way to implement this, but ideally the abilities should be modular and as self contained as possible. If you have some ideas/feedback on how to better keep this decoupled, please let me know!\n\n### CaAirControl\nAllows player to turn the vehicle in the air. Implementation is the same as CP_Turning.\n\n![Stationary360](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/Stationary360.gif)\n\n### CaJump\nThe force is applied as an Impulse at the center of mass so that the vehicle jumps directly upwards without any rotation. Press the input down to charge the jump to a max force and jump on release.\n\n![SmallJump](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/SmallJump.gif)\n\n### CaDrift\nAllows the vehicle to slide. This is done by reducing the `TyreStickiness` which decreases the corrective side Impulses in the CP_LateralFiction script. The `TyreStickiness` is reduced along the `DriftCurve` set by the designer. The duration in and out of the drift can be set by the designer and this scales the movement up and down the Drift Curve.\n\n![Drift](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/Drift.gif)\n\nTo reduce the amount of forward speed lost when coming out of a drift, the corrective side impulse is applied as a forward acceleration.\n\n### CaBoost\nWhile boosting an extra forward force is applied to the vehicle. There is a limited amount of time you can boost and it recharges while not boosting.\n\n![MediumLoop](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/MediumLoop.gif)\n\n# End Note\nThis is a work in progress. If you try it out, please let me know if you have any feedback on how I can improve this system.

Unity.\n\nThe repo use and test case is a car, but the scripts could be used for other vehicle types as well. The scripts involved in the project could be used for several types of vehicles if need be but the use and test case has been that of a car.\n\nThis is a side project and, while I have a lot of ideas on how to improve this, I'll be coming back to it when I have some free time. If you have any feedback or thoughts, please contact me via email or on twitter. \n\nIf you use this repo, I would love to see what you make!\n\n## Information\n\nThis project was built and tested for use with a controller. In the interest of keeping the dependencies light, I have used Unity's default Input manager.\n\nI would highly recommend [Sinput](https://sophieh.itch.io/sinput) by [Sophie Houlden](www.sophiehoulden.com)\n\n### Credits \n\nThe awesome [Muscle Car](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/flat-colored-muscle-car-5220c6fa750841d9a674d963a697bee4) model was created by [Asuza](https://sketchfab.com/azusanyan1992)\n\n### Dependencies\nArcadeVehiclePhysics.package\n* Unity Cinemachine\n* PostProcessing Stack\n\n**NOTE**: You may need to upgrade your version of Cinemachine depending on the version of Unity you are using.\n\nSample Scene\n* TextMeshPro\n* Probuilder - For Level geometry \n\n### Unity Version\nThis project was built and tested in `Unity 2018.4.5f1 LTS`\nOnce the project is further along, it will be tested in different versions in order to make sure there are no issues. \nContact me at hello@benmcinnes.com if you run into any issues.\n\n### References\nThe following talks have influenced my approach to vehicle physics:\n\n* [It IS Rocket Science!

It does not rotate, so that if the vehicle is spinning in the air the camera remains stable and manageable.\n\n![PanningIn](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/PanningIn.gif)\n\n## Car Abilities (CA)\nNow that the Physics and Visual rigs have been discussed (and set up on your side), it is time to give the vehicle some abilities. I mean, it is for a video game after all... \n\nStill experimenting with the best way to implement this, but ideally the abilities should be modular and as self contained as possible. If you have some ideas/feedback on how to better keep this decoupled, please let me know!\n\n### CaAirControl\nAllows player to turn the vehicle in the air. Implementation is the same as CP_Turning.\n\n![Stationary360](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/Stationary360.gif)\n\n### CaJump\nThe force is applied as an Impulse at the center of mass so that the vehicle jumps directly upwards without any rotation. Press the input down to charge the jump to a max force and jump on release.\n\n![SmallJump](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/SmallJump.gif)\n\n### CaDrift\nAllows the vehicle to slide. This is done by reducing the `TyreStickiness` which decreases the corrective side Impulses in the CP_LateralFiction script. The `TyreStickiness` is reduced along the `DriftCurve` set by the designer. The duration in and out of the drift can be set by the designer and this scales the movement up and down the Drift Curve.\n\n![Drift](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/Drift.gif)\n\nTo reduce the amount of forward speed lost when coming out of a drift, the corrective side impulse is applied as a forward acceleration.\n\n### CaBoost\nWhile boosting an extra forward force is applied to the vehicle. There is a limited amount of time you can boost and it recharges while not boosting.\n\n![MediumLoop](https://github.com/benmcinnes/ArcadeVehiclePhysics/blob/master/ReadmeFiles/MediumLoop.gif)\n\n# End Note\nThis is a work in progress. If you try it out, please let me know if you have any feedback on how I can improve this system. You can contact me at hello@benmcinnes.com\n"}, "gcschmit/vpython-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "gcschmit/vpython-physics", "diskUsage": 198, "name": "vpython-physics", "owner": {"login": "gcschmit"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2012-07-08T19:13:43Z", "pushedAt": "2013-10-05T04:22:57Z", "object": {"text": "vpython-physics\n===============\n\ncollection of computational physics models using physutil and VPython\n\nI created this repository to share various models that I created for my AP Physics B class.

It is recommended that students make themselves familiar with Linux, since it is the most easy way to get access to a C++ compiler. There is a wide variety of different Linux distributions available.

OpenSuse, Fedora and Ubuntu are examples for such distributions.\n\nIf you have a Mac, then just grab the XCode package from the app store and subsequently install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). Via MacPorts you can later install all further required software such as GNUplot or CMake.\n\nIf you want to run Linux on your computer, you have three different possibilities, each one having advantages and disadvantages:\n- install Linux next to your Windows,\n- run Linux in a virtual machine under Windows,\n- run Linux from a USB drive.\n\nInstalling Linux next to Windows and then choose which OS to run at boot time would be the ideal situation. However, if you already have a running Windows on your computer and no free partitions on your hard disk, it is maybe the most complicated out of the three possibilities to set up.\n\nRunning Linux in a virtual machine is the preferred option. The basic idea is that you run Linux on a simulated computer under Windows. Sounds slow and complicated, but is rather simple to set-up. The software which you need to simulate that virtual computer is called [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and it is free.\n\nIf for some reason the solution using VirtualBox should not work, you can use a USB stick and boot Linux from there. For Windows there is an excellent tool to create a Linux USB stick, the [Linux Live USB creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com) (short LiLi). It offers a broad range of different Linux distributions which it can download and deploy to the USB stick. Since you will want to make modifications to your live Linux, such as installing additional software (e.g. the C++ compiler) you should choose a distribution which offers *persistence* (see the docs on the LiLi website which Linux distributions offer this feature).\n\n#### Links\n- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)\n- [Linux Live USB creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com)\n- A [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYMLSpBdRec) on how to use LiLi\n- [Microsoft Dreamspark](http://www.dreamspark.com/), the place to go for the Windows C++ compiler\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "67e2c600a4c5e0cabb0d3f00cfd436a5f4fa8314 4"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 3, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 20, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Added information", "message": "Added information"}}, {"node": {"additions": 19, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Linux section added", "message": "Linux section added"}}, {"node": {"additions": 9, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "erste versionerste versio", "message": "erste versionerste versio"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}]}}}}, "name": "Computational-Physics", "owner": "philipp90schulte", "creation_date": "2015-10-20T12:11:11Z", "last_push_date": "2015-10-19T17:40:37Z", "commit_page_data": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "67e2c600a4c5e0cabb0d3f00cfd436a5f4fa8314 4"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 3, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 20, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Added information", "message": "Added information"}}, {"node": {"additions": 19, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Linux section added", "message": "Linux section added"}}, {"node": {"additions": 9, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "erste versionerste versio", "message": "erste versionerste versio"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}]}, "has_next_page": false, "commits": [{"node": {"additions": 3, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 20, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Added information", "message": "Added information"}}, {"node": {"additions": 19, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Linux section added", "message": "Linux section added"}}, {"node": {"additions": 9, "author": {"name": "Goetz Lehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "erste versionerste versio", "message": "erste versionerste versio"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "goetzlehmann"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}], "total_commits": 5, "languages": [], "readme_text": "# Computational Physics WS 2015/16\n\nThe lecture introduces advanced students to numerical methods and concepts relevant for physics.

Since you will want to make modifications to your live Linux, such as installing additional software (e.g. the C++ compiler) you should choose a distribution which offers *persistence* (see the docs on the LiLi website which Linux distributions offer this feature).\n\n#### Links\n- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)\n- [Linux Live USB creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com)\n- A [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYMLSpBdRec) on how to use LiLi\n- [Microsoft Dreamspark](http://www.dreamspark.com/), the place to go for the Windows C++ compiler\n"}, "Developer-Y/math-science-video-lectures": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Developer-Y/math-science-video-lectures", "diskUsage": 28, "name": "math-science-video-lectures", "owner": {"login": "Developer-Y"}, "languages": {"nodes": []}, "createdAt": "2016-12-01T19:35:03Z", "pushedAt": "2019-03-02T20:11:25Z", "object": {"text": "## List of Science & Math courses with video lectures\n\nPlease note this is collection of courses on Science and math, please do not add talks to the list.\n\n## Physics\n\n- **General (uncategorized)**\n\t- [8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999, Walter Lewin](http://academictorrents.com/details/f231c62635aadfb0e4d1f45ddc7b5b6c5592b275) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUdYlQf0_sSsb2tNcA3gtgOt8LGH6tJbr))\n\t- [8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism, Spring 2002, Walter Lewin](http://academictorrents.com/details/7010163eae33fbac6c065095e908c2c49550b931) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUdYlQf0_sSsfcNOPSNPQKHDhSjTJATPu))\n\t- [8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves, Fall 2004, Walter Lewin](http://academictorrents.com/details/724648552d517756117b47b3a7f5f62962f2629e) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUdYlQf0_sSsdOhQ_8jfrAGzbGbJ7MXGe))\n\t- [Collection of Physics video lectures](https://futurism.com/ultimate-collection-free-physics-videos/)\n\t- [The Mechanical Universe - Caltech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8_xPU5epJddRABXqJ5h5G0dk-XGtA5cZ)\n\t- [8.421 Atomic and Optical Physics I, MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-421-atomic-and-optical-physics-i-spring-2014/video-lectures/)\n\t- [8.422 Atomic and Optical Physics II, MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-422-atomic-and-optical-physics-ii-spring-2013/video-lectures/)\n\t- [8.821 String Theory and Holographic Duality, MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-821-string-theory-and-holographic-duality-fall-2014/)\n\t- [8.851 Effective Field Theory, MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-851-effective-field-theory-spring-2013/video-lectures/)\n\t- [The Theoretical Minimum, Leonard Susskind, Stanford University](http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses) ([YouTube - All lectures in order](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrxduI9Pds1fm91Dmn8x1lo-O_kpZGk8)), courses:\n\t  - Classical Mechanics\n\t  - Quantum Mechanics\n\t  - Special Relativity and Electrodynamics\n\t  - General Relativity\n\t  - Cosmology\n\t  - Statistical Mechanics\n\t  - Advanced Quantum Mechanics\n\t  - Higgs Boson\n\t  - Quantum Entanglement\n\t  - Relativity\n\t  - Particle Physics 1: Basic Concepts\n\t  - Particle Physics 2: Standard Model\n\t  - Particle Physics 3: Supersymmetry and Grand Unification\n\t  - String Theory\n\t  - Cosmology and Black Holes\n\t- [Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6G_2_0gFDqFjq4gZbmDvJT4bnvnNwr-)\n\t- [PHYS 200: FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS I, Yale University](http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200)\n\t- [PHYS 201: FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS II, Yale University](http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201)\n\t- [Physics 3A: Basic Physics (English), UC Irvine](http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/physics_3a_basic_physics.html)\n\t- [Physics 3B: Basic Physics II (English)](http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/physics_3b_basic_physics_ii.html)\n\t- [Physics 3C: Basic Physics III (English), UC Irvine](http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/physics_3c_basic_physics_iii.html)\n\t- [Physics 255: General Relativity, UC Irvine](http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/einsteins_general_relativity_and_gravitation.html)\n\t- [Physics 20B: Cosmology (English), UC Irvine](http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/physics_20b_cosmology.html)\n\t- [Physics 8B - Introductory Physics - Melvin Pomerantz, Spring 2015 - UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XXv-cvA_iDLzEJt081W3hahBzuTX7An)\n\t- [Physics 10, 001 - Spring 2006 - UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL095393D5B42B2266)\n\t- [Physics C10 - Descriptive Introduction to Physics, Spring 2014 - UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XXv-cvA_iAKxxGD1tIWLS0DcieGLHh0)\n\t- [Physics 111 - Advanced Experimentation Lab - UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18E88897D2310BD5)\n\t- [Physics 151 - Physics for Future Physicists, Fall 2013 - UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XXv-cvA_iDR8yysdRyQ0NNxdRgnNBNl)\n\t- [Physics 253: Quantum Field Theory Lectures by Sidney R.

Do a **Word2Vec encoding** of physics jargon (using gensim's CBOW or skip-gram, if you care for specifics).\n   \n   Examples: \"particle + charge = electron\" and \"majorana + braiding = non-abelian\"  \n   Remark: These examples were _learned_ from the cond-mat section titles only.\n\n2. Analyze the **n-grams** (i.e. fixed n-word expressions) in the titles over the years (what should we work on? ;-))\n3. Produce a **WordCloud** of your favorite arXiv section (such as the above, from the cond-mat section)\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everthemore/physics2vec/master/caltechwordcloud.png \"arXiv:cond-mat wordcloud\")\n\n## Notes\nThese scripts were tested and run using **Python 3**. I have not checked backwards compatibility, but I have heard from people who managed to get it to work in **Python 2** too! Feel free to reach out to me in case things don't work out-of-the-box. I have not (yet) tried to make the scripts and notebooks super user-friendly, though I did try to comment the code such that you may figure things out by\ntrial-and-error. \n\n## Quickstart ##\nIf you're already familiar with python, all you need to have are the modules numpy, pyoai, inflect and gensim. These should all be easy to install using pip/pip3. Then the workflow is as follows (I used python3):\n1. python arXivHarvest.py --section physics:cond-mat --output condmattitles.txt\n2. python parsetitles.py --input condmattitles.txt --output condmattitles.npy\n3. python trainmodel.py --input condmattitles.npy --size 100 --window 10 --mincount 5 --output condmatmodel-100-10-5\n4. python askmodel.py --input condmatmodel-100-10-5 --add particle charge\n\nIn step 1, we get the titles from arXiv. This is a time-consuming step; it took 1.5hrs for the physics:cond-mat section, and so I've provided the files for those in the repository already (i.e. you can skip steps 1 and 2). In step 2 we take out the weird symbols etc, and parse it into a \\*.npy file. In the third step, we train a model with vector size 100, window size 10 and minimum count for words to participate of 5. Step 4 can be repeated as often as one desires. \n\n## More details\nApart from the above scripts, I provide 3 python notebooks that perform more than just the analysis of arXiv titles. I highly \nrecommend using notebooks. Very easy to install, and super useful. See here: http://jupyter.org/. You can also just copy-and-paste the code from the notebooks into a \\*.py script and run those.\n\nYou are going to need to following python modules in addition, all installable using pip3 (sudo pip3 install [module-name]).\n\n1. numpy \n\n   Must-have for anything scientific you want to do with python (arrays, linalg)     \n   Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)\n   \n2. pyoai \n\n   Open Archive Initiaive module for querying the arXiv servers for metadata     \n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoai\n   \n3. inflect\n   \n   Module for generating/checking plural/singular versions of words     \n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inflect\n   \n4. gensim\n\n   Very versatile module for topic modelling (analyzing basically anything you want from text, including word2vec)  \n   https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\n\nNot required, but highly recommended is the module \"matplotlib\" for creating plots. You can comment/remove the\nsections in the code that refer to it if you really don't want to. \n\nOptionally, if you wish to make a WordCloud, you will need\n\n5. Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)\n6. PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)\n7. WordCloud (https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud)\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 27, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "d437efa21cb56423fba6653cf48af3e528b26114

notebooks that\n1. Do a **Word2Vec encoding** of physics jargon (using gensim's CBOW or skip-gram, if you care for specifics).\n   \n   Examples: \"particle + charge = electron\" and \"majorana + braiding = non-abelian\"  \n   Remark: These examples were _learned_ from the cond-mat section titles only.\n\n2. Analyze the **n-grams** (i.e. fixed n-word expressions) in the titles over the years (what should we work on? ;-))\n3. Produce a **WordCloud** of your favorite arXiv section (such as the above, from the cond-mat section)\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everthemore/physics2vec/master/caltechwordcloud.png \"arXiv:cond-mat wordcloud\")\n\n## Notes\nThese scripts were tested and run using **Python 3**. I have not checked backwards compatibility, but I have heard from people who managed to get it to work in **Python 2** too! Feel free to reach out to me in case things don't work out-of-the-box. I have not (yet) tried to make the scripts and notebooks super user-friendly, though I did try to comment the code such that you may figure things out by\ntrial-and-error. \n\n## Quickstart ##\nIf you're already familiar with python, all you need to have are the modules numpy, pyoai, inflect and gensim. These should all be easy to install using pip/pip3. Then the workflow is as follows (I used python3):\n1. python arXivHarvest.py --section physics:cond-mat --output condmattitles.txt\n2. python parsetitles.py --input condmattitles.txt --output condmattitles.npy\n3. python trainmodel.py --input condmattitles.npy --size 100 --window 10 --mincount 5 --output condmatmodel-100-10-5\n4. python askmodel.py --input condmatmodel-100-10-5 --add particle charge\n\nIn step 1, we get the titles from arXiv. This is a time-consuming step; it took 1.5hrs for the physics:cond-mat section, and so I've provided the files for those in the repository already (i.e. you can skip steps 1 and 2). In step 2 we take out the weird symbols etc, and parse it into a \\*.npy file. In the third step, we train a model with vector size 100, window size 10 and minimum count for words to participate of 5. Step 4 can be repeated as often as one desires. \n\n## More details\nApart from the above scripts, I provide 3 python notebooks that perform more than just the analysis of arXiv titles. I highly \nrecommend using notebooks. Very easy to install, and super useful. See here: http://jupyter.org/. You can also just copy-and-paste the code from the notebooks into a \\*.py script and run those.\n\nYou are going to need to following python modules in addition, all installable using pip3 (sudo pip3 install [module-name]).\n\n1. numpy \n\n   Must-have for anything scientific you want to do with python (arrays, linalg)     \n   Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)\n   \n2. pyoai \n\n   Open Archive Initiaive module for querying the arXiv servers for metadata     \n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoai\n   \n3. inflect\n   \n   Module for generating/checking plural/singular versions of words     \n   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inflect\n   \n4. gensim\n\n   Very versatile module for topic modelling (analyzing basically anything you want from text, including word2vec)  \n   https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\n\nNot required, but highly recommended is the module \"matplotlib\" for creating plots. You can comment/remove the\nsections in the code that refer to it if you really don't want to. \n\nOptionally, if you wish to make a WordCloud, you will need\n\n5. Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)\n6. PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)\n7. WordCloud (https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud)\n"}, "zhaoyongfeng1990/Physics_Notes": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "zhaoyongfeng1990/Physics_Notes", "diskUsage": 1155, "name": "Physics_Notes",

similar to my favorite Emacs package [emacs-inertial-scroll](https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-inertial-scroll).\n\nScroll with `C-d`/`C-u`:\n![Scroll with `C-d`/`C-u`](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/21579969/841ab468-d013-11e6-8ce6-aa5442d52b6b.gif)\n\nScroll with `C-f`/`C-b`:\n![Scroll with `C-f`/`C-b`](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/21579968/841929ea-d013-11e6-82fb-e0f3d3e8e896.gif)\n\n\n## Requirements\nThis plugin depends on the timer API, which requires Vim/Neovim to be at least the following version:\n\n- Vim 7.4.1578 or above\n- Neovim 0.1.5 or above\n\nHowever, currently, this plugin is only tested on Vim 8.0 and Neovim 0.1.7, i.e. my current development environment.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nFor example, with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):\n```vim\nPlug 'yuttie/comfortable-motion.vim'\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nPlease note that the following mappings for `<C-d>` and `<C-u>` are not ones for you if you expect they scroll a buffer just half a window.\n\n### Scrolling Method\n\nThis plugin relies on `<C-e>` and `<C-y>` by default to actually scroll a window.\nYou can customize these keys to other combinations like `j` and `k` as follows:\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_scroll_down_key = \"j\"\nlet g:comfortable_motion_scroll_up_key = \"k\"\n```\n\nThis results in:\n\n![Different scrolling method](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/24331179/ebc5b106-1269-11e7-90c2-747a68dec44b.gif)\n\nPlease note that you cannot choose complex keys consisting of multiple motions, e.g. `$j`.\nThis is because the current implementation prepends the number of scroll amount to the keys, e.g. `5$j`, and executes it once per simulation tick.\n\n\n### Keys and Mouse Wheel\n\nBy default, the following key mappings are defined.\n\n```vim\nnnoremap <silent> <C-d> :call comfortable_motion#flick(100)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-u> :call comfortable_motion#flick(-100)<CR>\n\nnnoremap <silent> <C-f> :call comfortable_motion#flick(200)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-b> :call comfortable_motion#flick(-200)<CR>\n```\n\nTo prevent the plugin from defining those default key mappings,\nyou can set `g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings` to 1.\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings = 1\n```\n\n\nAdditionally, if your Vim/NeoVim has mouse support, you can get mouse wheel to scroll a window by the following mappings:\n\n```vim\nnoremap <silent> <ScrollWheelDown> :call comfortable_motion#flick(40)<CR>\nnoremap <silent> <ScrollWheelUp>   :call comfortable_motion#flick(-40)<CR>\n```\n\nYou may need to enable the `mouse` option for the above to work, for example, by `set mouse=a`.\n\n\n### Simulation Parameters\n\nThere are three configurable parameters:\n\n* `g:comfortable_motion_interval` [default: 1000.0 / 60]\n* `g:comfortable_motion_friction` [default: 80.0]\n* `g:comfortable_motion_air_drag` [default: 2.0]\n\nFor example, with any of the following configurations, you can get `<C-u>`/`<C-d>` (with the\ndefault impulse value of `-100`/`100`) to scroll a window about 25 lines, but\ntastes are different.\n\n\n### Friction & Air Resistance\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 80.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 2.0\n```\n\n\n### Friction Only\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 200.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 0.0\n```\n\n\n### Air Resistance Only\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 0.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 4.0\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Configurations\n\nIf you would like to use scrolling proportional to the window height,\nyou may use settings such as these:\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings = 1\nlet g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier = 1  \" Feel free to increase/decrease this value.\nnnoremap <silent> <C-d> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * 2)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-u> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * -2)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-f> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * 4)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-b> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * -4)<CR>\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 38, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "e20aeafb07c6184727b29f7674530150f7ab2036

smooth scrolling to the Vim/Neovim world!\n\nThis is highly motivated by the lack of a plugin similar to my favorite Emacs package [emacs-inertial-scroll](https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-inertial-scroll).\n\nScroll with `C-d`/`C-u`:\n![Scroll with `C-d`/`C-u`](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/21579969/841ab468-d013-11e6-8ce6-aa5442d52b6b.gif)\n\nScroll with `C-f`/`C-b`:\n![Scroll with `C-f`/`C-b`](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/21579968/841929ea-d013-11e6-82fb-e0f3d3e8e896.gif)\n\n\n## Requirements\nThis plugin depends on the timer API, which requires Vim/Neovim to be at least the following version:\n\n- Vim 7.4.1578 or above\n- Neovim 0.1.5 or above\n\nHowever, currently, this plugin is only tested on Vim 8.0 and Neovim 0.1.7, i.e. my current development environment.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nFor example, with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):\n```vim\nPlug 'yuttie/comfortable-motion.vim'\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nPlease note that the following mappings for `<C-d>` and `<C-u>` are not ones for you if you expect they scroll a buffer just half a window.\n\n### Scrolling Method\n\nThis plugin relies on `<C-e>` and `<C-y>` by default to actually scroll a window.\nYou can customize these keys to other combinations like `j` and `k` as follows:\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_scroll_down_key = \"j\"\nlet g:comfortable_motion_scroll_up_key = \"k\"\n```\n\nThis results in:\n\n![Different scrolling method](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/158553/24331179/ebc5b106-1269-11e7-90c2-747a68dec44b.gif)\n\nPlease note that you cannot choose complex keys consisting of multiple motions, e.g. `$j`.\nThis is because the current implementation prepends the number of scroll amount to the keys, e.g. `5$j`, and executes it once per simulation tick.\n\n\n### Keys and Mouse Wheel\n\nBy default, the following key mappings are defined.\n\n```vim\nnnoremap <silent> <C-d> :call comfortable_motion#flick(100)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-u> :call comfortable_motion#flick(-100)<CR>\n\nnnoremap <silent> <C-f> :call comfortable_motion#flick(200)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-b> :call comfortable_motion#flick(-200)<CR>\n```\n\nTo prevent the plugin from defining those default key mappings,\nyou can set `g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings` to 1.\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings = 1\n```\n\n\nAdditionally, if your Vim/NeoVim has mouse support, you can get mouse wheel to scroll a window by the following mappings:\n\n```vim\nnoremap <silent> <ScrollWheelDown> :call comfortable_motion#flick(40)<CR>\nnoremap <silent> <ScrollWheelUp>   :call comfortable_motion#flick(-40)<CR>\n```\n\nYou may need to enable the `mouse` option for the above to work, for example, by `set mouse=a`.\n\n\n### Simulation Parameters\n\nThere are three configurable parameters:\n\n* `g:comfortable_motion_interval` [default: 1000.0 / 60]\n* `g:comfortable_motion_friction` [default: 80.0]\n* `g:comfortable_motion_air_drag` [default: 2.0]\n\nFor example, with any of the following configurations, you can get `<C-u>`/`<C-d>` (with the\ndefault impulse value of `-100`/`100`) to scroll a window about 25 lines, but\ntastes are different.\n\n\n### Friction & Air Resistance\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 80.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 2.0\n```\n\n\n### Friction Only\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 200.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 0.0\n```\n\n\n### Air Resistance Only\n\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_friction = 0.0\nlet g:comfortable_motion_air_drag = 4.0\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Configurations\n\nIf you would like to use scrolling proportional to the window height,\nyou may use settings such as these:\n```vim\nlet g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings = 1\nlet g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier = 1  \" Feel free to increase/decrease this value.\nnnoremap <silent> <C-d> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * 2)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-u> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * -2)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-f> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * 4)<CR>\nnnoremap <silent> <C-b> :call comfortable_motion#flick(g:comfortable_motion_impulse_multiplier * winheight(0) * -4)<CR>\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n"}, "Jam3/touch-scroll-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Jam3/touch-scroll-physics", "diskUsage": 214, "name": "touch-scroll-physics", "owner":

touch-scroll-physics\n\n[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)\n\n[(demo)](http://jam3.github.io/touch-scroll-physics) - [(source)](test.js)\n\nPhysics for a touch-based scroll panel. Assumes a single dimension but could easily be extended to two or more.\n\nWorks best with scroll panes that have a fixed bounding region and need to \"bounce\" on either end. Can also \"dip\" into the cell edges (for example: carousels, list views, grids).\n\nMakes no assumptions about the method of input or render engine (Canvas/DOM/WebGL/etc) but works well alongside [touches](https://github.com/Jam3/touches). Simple example:\n\n```js\nvar scroller = require('touch-scroll-physics')({\n    cellSize: 100,   //size of the content\n    viewSize: 400    //size of the viewport / clip region \n})\n\n//tick the scroller \nfunction render(dt) {\n    scroller.update(dt)\n}\n\n//and hook up mouse to scroller start(x) / move(x) / end(x) \n```\n\nSee [test.js](test.js) for a more complete example with cells.\n\n## Demo\n\nRun the demo [here](http://jam3.github.io/touch-scroll-physics) or build it yourself like so:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/Jam3/touch-scroll-physics.git\ncd touch-scroll-physics\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen open `localhost:9966`.

Typically when rendering you would translate content by the negative of this.\n\n#### `scroller.momentum`\n\nThe current momentum for the scroller.

Assumes a single dimension but could easily be extended to two or more.\n\nWorks best with scroll panes that have a fixed bounding region and need to \"bounce\" on either end. Can also \"dip\" into the cell edges (for example: carousels, list views, grids).\n\nMakes no assumptions about the method of input or render engine (Canvas/DOM/WebGL/etc) but works well alongside [touches](https://github.com/Jam3/touches). Simple example:\n\n```js\nvar scroller = require('touch-scroll-physics')({\n    cellSize: 100,   //size of the content\n    viewSize: 400    //size of the viewport / clip region \n})\n\n//tick the scroller \nfunction render(dt) {\n    scroller.update(dt)\n}\n\n//and hook up mouse to scroller start(x) / move(x) / end(x) \n```\n\nSee [test.js](test.js) for a more complete example with cells.\n\n## Demo\n\nRun the demo [here](http://jam3.github.io/touch-scroll-physics) or build it yourself like so:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/Jam3/touch-scroll-physics.git\ncd touch-scroll-physics\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen open `localhost:9966`.

In the current era of abundance of data and advanced machine learning capabilities, the natural question arises: How can we automatically uncover the underlying laws of physics from high-dimensional data generated from experiments? In this work, we put forth a deep learning approach for discovering nonlinear partial differential equations from scattered and potentially noisy observations in space and time. Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The first network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical differentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientific domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the following:

Physics Models](https://maziarraissi.github.io/DeepHPMs/)\n\nA long-standing problem at the interface of artificial intelligence and applied mathematics is to devise an algorithm capable of achieving human level or even superhuman proficiency in transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world. In the current era of abundance of data and advanced machine learning capabilities, the natural question arises: How can we automatically uncover the underlying laws of physics from high-dimensional data generated from experiments? In this work, we put forth a deep learning approach for discovering nonlinear partial differential equations from scattered and potentially noisy observations in space and time. Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The first network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical differentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientific domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the following: (https://maziarraissi.github.io/DeepHPMs/)\n\n  - Raissi, Maziar. \"[Deep Hidden Physics Models: Deep Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06637).\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.06637 (2018).\n\n## Citation\n\n    @article{raissi2018deep,\n      title={Deep Hidden Physics Models: Deep Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations},\n      author={Raissi, Maziar},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.06637},\n      year={2018}\n    }\n"}, "mmmovania/HavokPhysicsTutorials": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "mmmovania/HavokPhysicsTutorials", "diskUsage": 200, "name": "HavokPhysicsTutorials", "owner": {"login": "mmmovania"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C++"}]}, "createdAt": "2014-03-29T10:40:40Z", "pushedAt": "2014-04-01T13:27:27Z", "object": {"text": "HavokPhysicsTutorials\n=====================\nThis is the supporting repository for my Havok Physics Engine Tutorial Series available here: http://mmmovania.blogspot.com/2014/03/havok-physics-engine-tutorial-series.html.

And run the following command:\n\n```\nsh train_physics.sh --gpu your_gpu_number --dataset path_to_your_dataset\n```\n\nBy default, the models and log will be saved to `~/.model_cache/physics_pred/`. \nBesides, multi-gpu training is not supported for now.\nYou can restore your training by setting `restore_path` parameter.\n\n## Validate your training\n\nDuring training, the reported losses including `loss`, `preserve_distance_loss`, `un_velocity_loss`, and `velocity_loss` should usually keep decreasing.\nAt the end of the training, `velocity_loss` should be around `0.0006`.\n\nAdditionally, we provide two example bash scripts for quantatively and qualitatively verifying the trained model. \nBesides, we also provide a pretrained model trained using the training bash script in the dataset.\n\nNow if you want to run a qualitative test, you can go to folder `scripts`. And run the following command:\n\n```\nsh test_physics_qual.sh --gpu your_gpu_number --dataset path_to_your_dataset --restore_path path_to_your_dataset/pretrained_model/checkpoint-384000\n```\n\nBy default, this will generate two pickle files named as `true_results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` and `results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` in your home directory.\nYou can change saving directly by setting `SAVE_DIR` parameter. Please check examples of visualizing these results in `visualize` folder.\n\nSimilarly for a quantitative test, you can just replace `test_physics_qual.sh` using `test_physics_quan.sh`. \nThen you will see the metrics also reported in our paper as outputs of this command.\nAnd the test result will be stored as `quant_results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` in your home directory by default.\n"},

Flexible neural representation for physics prediction\n\nCodes for reproducing main results in paper \"Flexible Neural Representation for Physics Prediction\".\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe have tested this repo under Ubuntu 16.04 with tensorflow version 1.9.0.\n\n## Prepare data\n\nFor now, we provide one dataset including two rigid cubes each of which contains 64 particles hitting each other on a static plane described by 5000 particles.\nYou can download the dataset through this [link](http://physicspredictiondata.s3.amazonaws.com/physics_dataset_new.tar).\nFor those who downloaded the dataset before Nov. 29th, please download it again as we updated the file to include pretrained model and validation files.\nAfter downloading, untar this file.\nPlease check README.md in `data` folder for more explanations about this dataset.\n\n## Start the training!\n\nGo to folder `scripts`. And run the following command:\n\n```\nsh train_physics.sh --gpu your_gpu_number --dataset path_to_your_dataset\n```\n\nBy default, the models and log will be saved to `~/.model_cache/physics_pred/`. \nBesides, multi-gpu training is not supported for now.\nYou can restore your training by setting `restore_path` parameter.\n\n## Validate your training\n\nDuring training, the reported losses including `loss`, `preserve_distance_loss`, `un_velocity_loss`, and `velocity_loss` should usually keep decreasing.\nAt the end of the training, `velocity_loss` should be around `0.0006`.\n\nAdditionally, we provide two example bash scripts for quantatively and qualitatively verifying the trained model. \nBesides, we also provide a pretrained model trained using the training bash script in the dataset.\n\nNow if you want to run a qualitative test, you can go to folder `scripts`. And run the following command:\n\n```\nsh test_physics_qual.sh --gpu your_gpu_number --dataset path_to_your_dataset --restore_path path_to_your_dataset/pretrained_model/checkpoint-384000\n```\n\nBy default, this will generate two pickle files named as `true_results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` and `results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` in your home directory.\nYou can change saving directly by setting `SAVE_DIR` parameter. Please check examples of visualizing these results in `visualize` folder.\n\nSimilarly for a quantitative test, you can just replace `test_physics_qual.sh` using `test_physics_quan.sh`. \nThen you will see the metrics also reported in our paper as outputs of this command.\nAnd the test result will be stored as `quant_results_physics_pred_better_8.pkl` in your home directory by default.\n"}, "maziarraissi/HPM": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "maziarraissi/HPM", "diskUsage": 93407, "name": "HPM", "owner": {"login": "maziarraissi"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "MATLAB"}, {"name": "Mathematica"}, {"name": "Java"}]}, "createdAt": "2017-12-03T19:55:03Z", "pushedAt": "2020-02-20T23:18:56Z", "object": {"text": "# [Hidden Physics Models](https://maziarraissi.github.io/HPM/)\n\nWe introduce Hidden Physics Models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian Processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schr\u00f6dinger, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the following: (https://maziarraissi.github.io/HPM/)\n\n  - Raissi, Maziar,

introduce Hidden Physics Models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian Processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schr\u00f6dinger, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the following: (https://maziarraissi.github.io/HPM/)\n\n  - Raissi, Maziar,

"object": {"text": "# Physics Tank Example\nThis project is meant to show three different ways to use Unity's standard WheelCollider to create a driveable tank. The code is commented, and there are tooltips on all the parameters for the TankPhysics component. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that this is very much just an example. While you could theoretically just plug this into a project and set it up, because it\u2019s so general purpose and prototype-like I would recommend deciding on which method you like best, and then simplifying the code to take only what you need.\n\nBuilt in **Unity 2017.3**.\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/tankrolling.gif)\n\n## Download\n\nYou can either clone the repository or [download the asset package](./PhysicsTankExample.unitypackage) located in the root.\n\n## The WheelCollider\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/wheelsuspension.png)\n\nWheelColliders are the secret to this. In my experience, as long as the suspension forces are in line with the mass value, the suspension is well behaved. In the case of this project, the tanks have a mass of 100 Unities, and then each wheel has a spring force of only 2000, with a very small damper value of 50.\n\n## The Tank\n\nThe tank is controlled with WASD, but with three very different implementations. All three tanks are in the TankDriving scene included in the package. Simply enable/disable whichever tank you want to drive.\n\n#### Wheel Collider lists\n\nThere are 5 lists of WheelColliders in the PhysicsTanks script. Feel free to put any WheelColliders in any of the lists that are relevant to that wheel. Wheels can be in multiple lists if they need to do multiple things. For example, a wheel that is both powered and steers would be in both the Front (or Rear) list, **and** the Powered Wheels list.\n\n#### Center of Mass\n\nTo aid in stability, and prevent the tank from flipping over during turns, you can override where the center of mass of the tank is. To use this, create a child GameObject of the tank, position it where you want the center of mass, and then assign that GameObject to the Center of Mass parameter.\n\n### Four Wheel Steering\n\nThis tank steers by turning the frontmost pair of wheels, and rearmost pair. The angle that the wheels turn is set by the Steering Angle parameter. In my opinion, this is the most fun and consistent tank to drive, but it has a big limitation in that it cannot turn in place. With \n\n### Differential Steering\n\nThis tank steers using the real life tank solution of one set of tracks turning more the other, or turning in the opposite direction. The problem with this in practice is that the sideways friction of a WheelCollider will prevent differential steering from working. For example, if you try to rotate clockwise, the wheels will fight that rotation, and they'll fight it harder the further away they are from the pivot point.\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/rotating.png)\n\nTo get around this, all the wheels except the two center ones have a sideways stiffness of 0.1, while the center ones have a sideways stiffness of 10. All the sideways traction is coming from the center wheels, but all the wheels can still apply forwards/reverse motion because their forward friction is untouched. This *mostly* works, but you can get into weird situations where one or both of your two center wheels are off the ground, and so the tank slips around in an unintuitive way. Just moving across rough terrain in general can cause some weird uncommanded turns that don\u2019t quite seem right.\n\n### Magic Steering\n\nThis one allows for both turning while standing still, and turning in a very controlled and predictable manner. Basically, the tank rotates with magic. You supply a Magic Turn Rate (45 degrees by default), and it just rotates the tank by rotating the rigidbody itself. Using rigid.MoveRotation, you still get the physics of suspension bobbing the tank around, while still being able to apply a turn with magic code.\n\n# Changelog\n\n### 1.0 (Feb 18 2018)\n\n- Released"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 12, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "4d8290ead56d98a9351ad6310f391b29b5a4959c 11"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:48:42Z", "messageHeadline": "Proofreading", "message": "Proofreading"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:47:29Z", "messageHeadline": "Updated readme", "message": "Updated readme"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:46:41Z", "messageHeadline": "Updated readme with disclaimer", "message": "Updated readme with disclaimer"}}, {"node": {"additions": 6087, "author": {"name": "brihernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:42:14Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge pull request #1 from brihernandez/develop", "message": "Merge pull request #1 from brihernandez/develop\n\nInitial Release"}}, {"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:40:29Z", "messageHeadline": "Package updated", "message": "Package updated"}}, {"node": {"additions": 7, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:38:15Z", "messageHeadline": "Changelog", "message": "Changelog"}}, {"node": {"additions": 35, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T05:37:10Z", "messageHeadline": "Updated readme", "message": "Updated readme"}}, {"node": {"additions": 12, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T03:43:11Z", "messageHeadline": "Moved FreeCamera, created package.", "message": "Moved FreeCamera, created package."}}, {"node": {"additions": 1342, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-18T03:20:47Z", "messageHeadline": "Magic rotation tank and clean up", "message": "Magic rotation tank and clean up\n- Moved wheelmodel prefab to separate folder\n- Fixed wheel left/right being backwards on all tanks\n- Added magic steering tank prefab\n- Commented the PhysicsTank example\n- Replaced spintorque with magic rotation\n- Re-organized tank physics file for readability"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2518, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-17T06:05:34Z", "messageHeadline": "Added tank controlled by differential steering.", "message": "Added tank controlled by differential steering."}}, {"node": {"additions": 3500, "author": {"name": "Brian Hernandez"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-16T05:27:35Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial commit.

The code is commented, and there are tooltips on all the parameters for the TankPhysics component. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that this is very much just an example. While you could theoretically just plug this into a project and set it up, because it\u2019s so general purpose and prototype-like I would recommend deciding on which method you like best, and then simplifying the code to take only what you need.\n\nBuilt in **Unity 2017.3**.\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/tankrolling.gif)\n\n## Download\n\nYou can either clone the repository or [download the asset package](./PhysicsTankExample.unitypackage) located in the root.\n\n## The WheelCollider\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/wheelsuspension.png)\n\nWheelColliders are the secret to this. In my experience, as long as the suspension forces are in line with the mass value, the suspension is well behaved. In the case of this project, the tanks have a mass of 100 Unities, and then each wheel has a spring force of only 2000, with a very small damper value of 50.\n\n## The Tank\n\nThe tank is controlled with WASD, but with three very different implementations. All three tanks are in the TankDriving scene included in the package. Simply enable/disable whichever tank you want to drive.\n\n#### Wheel Collider lists\n\nThere are 5 lists of WheelColliders in the PhysicsTanks script. Feel free to put any WheelColliders in any of the lists that are relevant to that wheel. Wheels can be in multiple lists if they need to do multiple things. For example, a wheel that is both powered and steers would be in both the Front (or Rear) list, **and** the Powered Wheels list.\n\n#### Center of Mass\n\nTo aid in stability, and prevent the tank from flipping over during turns, you can override where the center of mass of the tank is. To use this, create a child GameObject of the tank, position it where you want the center of mass, and then assign that GameObject to the Center of Mass parameter.\n\n### Four Wheel Steering\n\nThis tank steers by turning the frontmost pair of wheels, and rearmost pair. The angle that the wheels turn is set by the Steering Angle parameter. In my opinion, this is the most fun and consistent tank to drive, but it has a big limitation in that it cannot turn in place. With \n\n### Differential Steering\n\nThis tank steers using the real life tank solution of one set of tracks turning more the other, or turning in the opposite direction. The problem with this in practice is that the sideways friction of a WheelCollider will prevent differential steering from working. For example, if you try to rotate clockwise, the wheels will fight that rotation, and they'll fight it harder the further away they are from the pivot point.\n\n![screenshot](Screenshots/rotating.png)\n\nTo get around this, all the wheels except the two center ones have a sideways stiffness of 0.1, while the center ones have a sideways stiffness of 10. All the sideways traction is coming from the center wheels, but all the wheels can still apply forwards/reverse motion because their forward friction is untouched. This *mostly* works, but you can get into weird situations where one or both of your two center wheels are off the ground, and so the tank slips around in an unintuitive way. Just moving across rough terrain in general can cause some weird uncommanded turns that don\u2019t quite seem right.\n\n### Magic Steering\n\nThis one allows for both turning while standing still, and turning in a very controlled and predictable manner. Basically, the tank rotates with magic. You supply a Magic Turn Rate (45 degrees by default), and it just rotates the tank by rotating the rigidbody itself. Using rigid.MoveRotation, you still get the physics of suspension bobbing the tank around, while still being able to apply a turn with magic code.\n\n# Changelog\n\n### 1.0 (Feb 18 2018)\n\n- Released"}, "marmitoTH/Godot-Sonic-Physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "marmitoTH/Godot-Sonic-Physics", "diskUsage": 3547, "name": "Godot-Sonic-Physics", "owner": {"login": "marmitoTH"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "GDScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-03-16T23:09:44Z", "pushedAt": "2019-03-16T23:12:48Z", "object": {"text": "# Godot-Sonic-Physics\n\n![Godot Sonic Physics](https://i.imgur.com/2qPKkQt.png)\n\n## License\n\nAll sprites and audios are property of Sega, you can't use them for comercial purpose.\n\nThe scripts are made by me and are under the MIT No Attribution license, no credits needed, but very appreciated."}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "d8e255e03c56ec56ea29a06499683e32e77ef8c7 0"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 2017, "author": {"name": "Lucas"}, "pushedDate": "2019-03-16T23:12:48Z", "messageHeadline": "init", "message": "init"}}]}}}}, "name": "Godot-Sonic-Physics", "owner": "marmitoTH", "creation_date": "2019-03-16T23:09:44Z", "last_push_date": "2019-03-16T23:12:48Z", "commit_page_data": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "d8e255e03c56ec56ea29a06499683e32e77ef8c7 0"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 2017, "author": {"name": "Lucas"}, "pushedDate": "2019-03-16T23:12:48Z", "messageHeadline": "init", "message": "init"}}]}, "has_next_page": false, "commits": [{"node": {"additions": 2017, "author": {"name": "Lucas"}, "pushedDate": "2019-03-16T23:12:48Z", "messageHeadline": "init", "message": "init"}}], "total_commits": 1, "languages": ["GDScript"], "readme_text": "# Godot-Sonic-Physics\n\n![Godot Sonic Physics](https://i.imgur.com/2qPKkQt.png)\n\n## License\n\nAll sprites and audios are property of Sega, you can't use them for comercial purpose.\n\nThe scripts are made by me and are under the MIT No Attribution license, no credits needed, but very appreciated."}, "SwapneelM/awesome-particle-physics-for-non-physicists": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "SwapneelM/awesome-particle-physics-for-non-physicists", "diskUsage": 26, "name": "awesome-particle-physics-for-non-physicists", "owner": {"login": "SwapneelM"}, "languages": {"nodes": []}, "createdAt": "2018-06-08T09:05:24Z", "pushedAt": "2018-09-04T12:13:45Z", "object": {"text": "# awesome-particle-physics-for-non-physicists [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)\n[Particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)\n[Particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation. Although the word \"particle\" can refer to various types of very small objects, \"particle physics\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the fundamental interactions necessary to explain their behaviour.\n\nThis is a curated list of **introductory** resources to fundamental concepts in particle physics including the Standard Model, QED, QCD, Jets, Colliders, and Detectors. The idea is to learn these concepts with no background knowledge necessary (for the most part)!\n\n**For the ones interested in a more thorough understanding, it is recommended you go through the background reading in Probability and Statistics before venturing into the links marked with a :warning: sign.**\n\n## Awesome list criteria\n\n1. The list includes videos (preferred), slides, notes, and other materials.\n2. Ensure that the links to videos, talks, and slides are publicly accessible.\n3. Add a descriptive title for the link, and place it under the appropriate category.\n4. For multiple related resources that may not necessarily link to each other, please add all the links separately in a part-by-part order.\n5. If you are unable to categorise the resources, please leave them under [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous--advanced)\n4. Adding resources on advanced subjects is encouraged, but do ensure the other resources present on the list cover the prerequisites for such topics - feel free to add those yourself.\n5.

The current release concentrates on reinforcement learning for robot manipulation. This library is designed to smoothly interoperate with the [Surreal Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://github.com/SurrealAI/Surreal).\n\nReinforcement learning has been a powerful and generic tool in robotics. Reinforcement learning combined with deep neural networks, i.e., *deep reinforcement learning* (DRL), has achieved some exciting successes in a variety of robot control problems. However, the challenges of reproducibility and replicability in DRL and robotics have impaired research progress. Our goal is to provide an accessible set of benchmarking tasks that facilitates a fair and rigorus evaluation and improves our understanding of new methods.\n\nThis framework was originally developed since late 2017 by researchers in [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) (SVL) as an internal tool for robot learning research. Today it is actively maintained and used for robotics research projects in SVL.\n\nThis release of Surreal Robotics Suite contains a set of benchmarking manipulation tasks and a modularized design of APIs for building new environments. We highlight these primary features below:\n\n* [**standardized tasks**](robosuite/environments): a set of single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks of large diversity and varying complexity.\n* [**procedural generation**](robosuite/models): modularized APIs for programmatically creating new scenes and new tasks as a combinations of robot models, arenas, and parameterized 3D objects;\n* [**controller modes**](robosuite/controllers): a selection of controller types to command the robots, such as joint velocity control, inverse kinematics control, and 3D motion devices for teleoperation;\n* **multi-modal sensors**: heterogeneous types of sensory signals, including low-level physical states, RGB cameras, depth maps, and proprioception;\n* [**human demonstrations**](docs/demonstrations.md): utilities for collecting human demonstrations, replaying demonstration datasets, and leveraging demonstration data for learning.\n\n## Installation\nSurreal Robotics Suite officially supports Mac OS X and Linux on Python 3.5 or 3.7. It can be run with an on-screen display for visualization or in a headless mode for model training, with or without a GPU.\n\nThe base installation requires the MuJoCo physics engine (with [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py), refer to link for troubleshooting the installation and further instructions) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). To avoid interfering with system packages, it is recommended to install it under a virtual environment by first running `virtualenv -p python3 . && source bin/activate`.\n\nFirst download MuJoCo 2.0 ([Linux](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_linux.zip) and [Mac OS X](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_macos.zip)) and unzip its contents into `~/.mujoco/mujoco200`, and copy your MuJoCo license key `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`. You can obtain a license key from [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).\n   - For Linux, you will need to install some packages to build `mujoco-py` (sourced from [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/blob/master/Dockerfile), with a couple missing packages added). If using `apt`, the required installation command is:\n     ```sh\n     $ sudo apt install curl git libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglew-dev \\\n             libosmesa6-dev software-properties-common net-tools unzip vim \\\n             virtualenv wget xpra xserver-xorg-dev libglfw3-dev patchelf\n     ```\n     Note that for older versions of Ubuntu (e.g., 14.04) there's no libglfw3 package, in which case you need to `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin` before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Install from pip\n1. After setting up mujoco, robosuite can be installed with\n```sh\n    $ pip install robosuite\n```\n\n2. Test your installation with\n```sh\n    $ python -m robosuite.demo\n```\n\n### Install from source\n1. Clone the robosuite repository\n```sh \n    $ git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/robosuite.git\n    $ cd robosuite\n```\n\n2. Install the base requirements with\n   ```sh\n   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   This will also install our library as an editable package, such that local changes will be reflected elsewhere without having to reinstall the package.\n\n3. (Optional) We also provide add-on functionalities, such as [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) [interfaces](robosuite/wrappers/gym_wrapper.py), [inverse kinematics controllers](robosuite/wrappers/ik_wrapper.py) powered by [PyBullet](http://bulletphysics.org), and [teleoperation](robosuite/scripts/demo_spacemouse_ik_control.py) with [SpaceMouse](https://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemouse.html) devices (Mac OS X only). To enable these additional features, please install the extra dependencies by running\n   ```sh\n   $ pip3 install -r requirements-extra.txt\n   ```\n\n4. Test your installation with\n```sh\n    $ python robosuite/demo.py\n```\n\n## Quick Start\nThe APIs we provide to interact with our environments are simple and similar to the ones used by [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/). Below is a minimalistic example of how to interact with an environment.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport robosuite as suite\n\n# create environment instance\nenv = suite.make(\"SawyerLift\", has_renderer=True)\n\n# reset the environment\nenv.reset()\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    action = np.random.randn(env.dof)  # sample random action\n    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # take action in the environment\n    env.render()  # render on display\n````\nThe `step()` function takes an `action` as input and returns a tuple of `(obs, reward, done, info)` where `obs` is an `OrderedDict` containing observations `[(name_string, np.array), ...]`, `reward` is the immediate reward obtained per step, `done` is a Boolean flag indicating if the episode has terminated and `info` is a dictionary which contains additional metadata.\n\nThere are other parameters which can be configured for each environment. They provide functionalities such as headless rendering, getting pixel observations, changing camera settings, using reward shaping, and adding extra low-level observations. Please refer to [this page](robosuite/environments/README.md) and the [environment classes](robosuite/environments) for further details.\n\nSample scripts that showcase various features of the Surreal Robotics Suite are available at [robosuite/scripts](robosuite/scripts). The purpose of each script and usage instructions can be found at the beginning of each file.\n\n## Building Your Own Environments\nA manipulation `task` typically involves the participation of a `robot` with `gripper`s as its end-effectors, an `arena` (workspace), and `object`s that the robot interacts with. Our APIs in [Models](robosuite/models) provide a toolkit of composing these modularized elements into a scene, which can be loaded in MuJoCo for simulation. To build your own environments, you are recommended to take a look at the [environment classes](robosuite/environments) which have used these APIs to define a set of standardized manipulation tasks. You can also find detailed documentations about [creating a custom object](docs/creating_object.md) and [creating a custom environment](docs/creating_environment.md).\n\n## Human Demonstrations\n\n### Collecting Human Demonstrations\n\nWe provide teleoperation utilities that allow users to control the robots with input devices, such as the keyboard and the [SpaceMouse](https://www.3dconnexion.com/spacemouse_compact/en/). Such functionality allows us to collect a dataset of human demonstrations for learning. We provide an example script to illustrate how to collect demonstrations. Our [collect_human_demonstrations](robosuite/scripts/collect_human_demonstrations.py) script takes the following arguments:\n\n- `directory:` path to a folder for where to store the pickle file of collected demonstrations\n- `environment:` name of the environment you would like to collect the demonstrations for\n- `device:` either \"keyboard\" or \"spacemouse\"\n\nOur twin project [RoboTurk](http://roboturk.stanford.edu) has collected pilot datasets of more than a thousand demonstrations for two tasks in our Suite via crowdsourcing. You can find detailed information about the [RoboTurk datasets](docs/demonstrations.md#roboturk-dataset) and [demonstration collection](docs/demonstrations.md#collecting-your-own-demonstrations) here.\n\n### Replaying Human Demonstrations\n\nWe have included an example script that illustrates how demonstrations can be loaded and played back. Our [playback_demonstrations_from_hdf5](robosuite/scripts/playback_demonstrations_from_hdf5.py) script selects demonstration episodes at random from a demonstration pickle file and replays them. We have included some sample demonstrations for each task at `models/assets/demonstrations`.\n\n### Using Demonstrations for Learning\n\n[Several](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09564) [prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06919) [works](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02717) have demonstrated the effectiveness of altering the start state distribution of training episodes for learning RL policies. We provide a generic utility for setting various types of learning curriculums which dictate how to sample from demonstration episodes when doing an environment reset. For more information see the `DemoSamplerWrapper` class. We have provided an example of how to use this wrapper along with a demonstration pickle file in the [demo_learning_curriculum](robosuite/scripts/demo_learning_curriculum.py) script.\n\n##

Suite\n\n## Latest Updates\n[03/08/2020] Added new [helper script](robosuite/scripts/tune_camera.py) to tune camera pose :camera:\n\n[02/08/2020] Added models and environments with the [Panda](https://www.franka.de/technology) arm from Franka Emika :panda_face:\n\n[12/10/2019] Migrated to MuJoCo 2.0 in our v0.3.0 release (install through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/robosuite/)) :tada:\n\n\n![gallery of_environments](resources/gallery.png)\n\n**Surreal Robotics Suite** is a tookit and simulation benchmark powered by the [MuJoCo physics engine](http://mujoco.org/) for reproducible robotics research. The current release concentrates on reinforcement learning for robot manipulation. This library is designed to smoothly interoperate with the [Surreal Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://github.com/SurrealAI/Surreal).\n\nReinforcement learning has been a powerful and generic tool in robotics. Reinforcement learning combined with deep neural networks, i.e., *deep reinforcement learning* (DRL), has achieved some exciting successes in a variety of robot control problems. However, the challenges of reproducibility and replicability in DRL and robotics have impaired research progress. Our goal is to provide an accessible set of benchmarking tasks that facilitates a fair and rigorus evaluation and improves our understanding of new methods.\n\nThis framework was originally developed since late 2017 by researchers in [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) (SVL) as an internal tool for robot learning research. Today it is actively maintained and used for robotics research projects in SVL.\n\nThis release of Surreal Robotics Suite contains a set of benchmarking manipulation tasks and a modularized design of APIs for building new environments. We highlight these primary features below:\n\n* [**standardized tasks**](robosuite/environments): a set of single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks of large diversity and varying complexity.\n* [**procedural generation**](robosuite/models): modularized APIs for programmatically creating new scenes and new tasks as a combinations of robot models, arenas, and parameterized 3D objects;\n* [**controller modes**](robosuite/controllers): a selection of controller types to command the robots, such as joint velocity control, inverse kinematics control, and 3D motion devices for teleoperation;\n* **multi-modal sensors**: heterogeneous types of sensory signals, including low-level physical states, RGB cameras, depth maps, and proprioception;\n* [**human demonstrations**](docs/demonstrations.md): utilities for collecting human demonstrations, replaying demonstration datasets, and leveraging demonstration data for learning.\n\n## Installation\nSurreal Robotics Suite officially supports Mac OS X and Linux on Python 3.5 or 3.7. It can be run with an on-screen display for visualization or in a headless mode for model training, with or without a GPU.\n\nThe base installation requires the MuJoCo physics engine (with [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py), refer to link for troubleshooting the installation and further instructions) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). To avoid interfering with system packages, it is recommended to install it under a virtual environment by first running `virtualenv -p python3 . && source bin/activate`.\n\nFirst download MuJoCo 2.0 ([Linux](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_linux.zip) and [Mac OS X](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_macos.zip)) and unzip its contents into `~/.mujoco/mujoco200`, and copy your MuJoCo license key `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`. You can obtain a license key from [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).\n   - For Linux, you will need to install some packages to build `mujoco-py` (sourced from [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/blob/master/Dockerfile), with a couple missing packages added). If using `apt`, the required installation command is:\n     ```sh\n     $ sudo apt install curl git libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglew-dev \\\n             libosmesa6-dev software-properties-common net-tools unzip vim \\\n             virtualenv wget xpra xserver-xorg-dev libglfw3-dev patchelf\n     ```\n     Note that for older versions of Ubuntu (e.g., 14.04) there's no libglfw3 package, in which case you need to `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin` before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Install from pip\n1. After setting up mujoco, robosuite can be installed with\n```sh\n    $ pip install robosuite\n```\n\n2. Test your installation with\n```sh\n    $ python -m robosuite.demo\n```\n\n### Install from source\n1. Clone the robosuite repository\n```sh \n    $ git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/robosuite.git\n    $ cd robosuite\n```\n\n2. Install the base requirements with\n   ```sh\n   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   This will also install our library as an editable package, such that local changes will be reflected elsewhere without having to reinstall the package.\n\n3. (Optional) We also provide add-on functionalities, such as [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) [interfaces](robosuite/wrappers/gym_wrapper.py), [inverse kinematics controllers](robosuite/wrappers/ik_wrapper.py) powered by [PyBullet](http://bulletphysics.org), and [teleoperation](robosuite/scripts/demo_spacemouse_ik_control.py) with [SpaceMouse](https://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemouse.html) devices (Mac OS X only). To enable these additional features, please install the extra dependencies by running\n   ```sh\n   $ pip3 install -r requirements-extra.txt\n   ```\n\n4. Test your installation with\n```sh\n    $ python robosuite/demo.py\n```\n\n## Quick Start\nThe APIs we provide to interact with our environments are simple and similar to the ones used by [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/). Below is a minimalistic example of how to interact with an environment.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport robosuite as suite\n\n# create environment instance\nenv = suite.make(\"SawyerLift\", has_renderer=True)\n\n# reset the environment\nenv.reset()\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    action = np.random.randn(env.dof)  # sample random action\n    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # take action in the environment\n    env.render()  # render on display\n````\nThe `step()` function takes an `action` as input and returns a tuple of `(obs, reward, done, info)` where `obs` is an `OrderedDict` containing observations `[(name_string, np.array), ...]`, `reward` is the immediate reward obtained per step, `done` is a Boolean flag indicating if the episode has terminated and `info` is a dictionary which contains additional metadata.\n\nThere are other parameters which can be configured for each environment. They provide functionalities such as headless rendering, getting pixel observations, changing camera settings, using reward shaping, and adding extra low-level observations. Please refer to [this page](robosuite/environments/README.md) and the [environment classes](robosuite/environments) for further details.\n\nSample scripts that showcase various features of the Surreal Robotics Suite are available at [robosuite/scripts](robosuite/scripts). The purpose of each script and usage instructions can be found at the beginning of each file.\n\n## Building Your Own Environments\nA manipulation `task` typically involves the participation of a `robot` with `gripper`s as its end-effectors, an `arena` (workspace), and `object`s that the robot interacts with. Our APIs in [Models](robosuite/models) provide a toolkit of composing these modularized elements into a scene, which can be loaded in MuJoCo for simulation. To build your own environments, you are recommended to take a look at the [environment classes](robosuite/environments) which have used these APIs to define a set of standardized manipulation tasks. You can also find detailed documentations about [creating a custom object](docs/creating_object.md) and [creating a custom environment](docs/creating_environment.md).\n\n## Human Demonstrations\n\n### Collecting Human Demonstrations\n\nWe provide teleoperation utilities that allow users to control the robots with input devices, such as the keyboard and the [SpaceMouse](https://www.3dconnexion.com/spacemouse_compact/en/). Such functionality allows us to collect a dataset of human demonstrations for learning. We provide an example script to illustrate how to collect demonstrations. Our [collect_human_demonstrations](robosuite/scripts/collect_human_demonstrations.py) script takes the following arguments:\n\n- `directory:` path to a folder for where to store the pickle file of collected demonstrations\n- `environment:` name of the environment you would like to collect the demonstrations for\n- `device:` either \"keyboard\" or \"spacemouse\"\n\nOur twin project [RoboTurk](http://roboturk.stanford.edu) has collected pilot datasets of more than a thousand demonstrations for two tasks in our Suite via crowdsourcing. You can find detailed information about the [RoboTurk datasets](docs/demonstrations.md#roboturk-dataset) and [demonstration collection](docs/demonstrations.md#collecting-your-own-demonstrations) here.\n\n### Replaying Human Demonstrations\n\nWe have included an example script that illustrates how demonstrations can be loaded and played back. Our [playback_demonstrations_from_hdf5](robosuite/scripts/playback_demonstrations_from_hdf5.py) script selects demonstration episodes at random from a demonstration pickle file and replays them. We have included some sample demonstrations for each task at `models/assets/demonstrations`.\n\n### Using Demonstrations for Learning\n\n[Several](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09564) [prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06919) [works](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02717) have demonstrated the effectiveness of altering the start state distribution of training episodes for learning RL policies. We provide a generic utility for setting various types of learning curriculums which dictate how to sample from demonstration episodes when doing an environment reset. For more information see the `DemoSamplerWrapper` class. We have provided an example of how to use this wrapper along with a demonstration pickle file in the [demo_learning_curriculum](robosuite/scripts/demo_learning_curriculum.py) script.\n\n## Citations\nPlease cite [Surreal](http://surreal.stanford.edu) if you use this repository in your publications:\n```\n@inproceedings{corl2018surreal,\n  title={SURREAL: Open-Source Reinforcement Learning Framework and Robot Manipulation Benchmark},\n  author={Fan, Linxi and Zhu, Yuke and Zhu, Jiren and Liu, Zihua and Zeng, Orien and Gupta, Anchit and Creus-Costa, Joan and Savarese, Silvio and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={Conference on Robot Learning},\n  year={2018}\n}\n```\n\nPlease also cite [RoboTurk](http://roboturk.stanford.edu) if you use the demonstration datasets:\n```\n@inproceedings{corl2018roboturk,\n  title={RoboTurk: A Crowdsourcing Platform for Robotic Skill Learning through Imitation},\n  author={Mandlekar, Ajay and Zhu, Yuke and Garg, Animesh and Booher, Jonathan and Spero, Max and Tung, Albert and Gao, Julian and Emmons, John and Gupta, Anchit and Orbay, Emre and Savarese, Silvio and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={Conference on Robot Learning},\n  year={2018}\n}\n```\n"}, "himanshub16/cool-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "himanshub16/cool-physics", "diskUsage": 35, "name": "cool-physics", "owner": {"login": "himanshub16"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "HTML"}, {"name": "JavaScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2017-02-22T09:04:40Z", "pushedAt": "2020-01-20T11:09:38Z", "object": {"text": "# cool-physics\n## Visualisations of awesome concepts from Physics\n\n\n### How does it work ?\n\nBuilt using [HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and :heart: .\n\n\n# Projects:\n1.

Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/game-physics-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123663), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.\r\n## About the Book\r\nPhysics are really important for game programmers who want to add realism and functionality to their games. Collision detection especially is a problem that affects all game developers, regardless of the platform, engine, or toolkit they use.\r\n\r\nThis book will teach you the concepts and formulas behind collision detection. You will also be taught how to build a simple physics engine, where Rigid Body physics is the main focus, and get to learn about intersection algorithms for primitive shapes.\r\n\r\n## Instructions and Navigations\r\nAll of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code will look like the following:\r\n```\r\n#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_\r\n#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_\r\n// Structure definitions\r\n// Method declarations\r\n#endif#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_\r\n#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_\r\n// Structure definitions\r\n// Method declarations\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n### Software and Hardware List\r\nWorking knowledge of the C++ language is required for this book, as the book is not a tutorial\r\nabout programming. Having a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra will be\r\nuseful, but is not required. You will need a Windows PC (preferably with Windows 7 or higher)\r\nwith Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 installed on it.\r\n\r\n## Related books\r\n\r\n* [Learning Game Physics with Bullet Physics and

Physics-Based Simulation class (Winter '12) we were asked to implement a large, non-trivial technique. My project is based on Matthias M\u00fcller's (et al.) research of applying Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to fluid simulation - essentially simulating fluid as thousands of small particles, rather than the traditional Eularian grid-based approach.\n\nFeel free to email me and I'll tell you more about this project!\n\n## Using the Simulator ##\n\nFirstly, click & drag to rotate the scene using typical GLVU camera controls. You'll notice the simulation starts in a stopped state - you'll need to toggle the animation ON. Below are some keyboard controls.\n\n### Basic Controls ###\n\na -- Toggle the physics animation on/off (upon starting animation is OFF)  \n1 -- Load the \"Dam Break\" scenario (initial scenario)  \n2 -- Load the \"Cube\" scenario  \n3 -- Load the \"Faucet\" scenario  \nt -- Toggle tumble mode on/off (the water will react to the tilt of the camera)  \n\n### Advanced Controls ##\n  \ng -- Toggle grid visible (grid used for neighbor particle optimization)  \n/ -- Toggle gravity on/off  \ns -- Toggle coloring of surface purple (particles on the surface have a surface tension force applied)  \nf -- Output current FPS to stdout  \n\n\n## References ##\n\nParticle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications  \nMatthias M\u00fcller, David Charypar and Markus Gross  \nhttp://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/sca03.pdf  \n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 16, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "c676768601b4e5412021c6b6c3a418ca47076be3 15"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2016-06-27T23:50:05Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-23T09:05:13Z", "messageHeadline": "Added image of fluid simulator in action.", "message": "Added image of fluid simulator in action."}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-23T03:56:37Z", "messageHeadline": "Added when the class was.", "message": "Added when the class was."}}, {"node": {"additions": 401, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-22T00:07:50Z", "messageHeadline": "No changes.", "message": "No changes."}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-21T23:50:46Z", "messageHeadline": "Removed extra horizontal lines from README", "message": "Removed extra horizontal lines from README"}}, {"node": {"additions": 30, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-21T23:48:11Z", "messageHeadline": "Formatted README with markdown.", "message": "Formatted README with markdown."}}, {"node": {"additions": 23, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-21T23:15:00Z", "messageHeadline": "Moved README.md to correct location (root of project)", "message": "Moved README.md to correct location (root of project)"}}, {"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": "2012-10-21T23:12:24Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/saeedmahani/SPH-Fluid-Sim\u2026", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/saeedmahani/SPH-Fluid-Simulation"}}, {"node": {"additions": 23, "author": {"name": "Saeed Mahani"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Prepped for github: Cleaned up code.

My project is based on Matthias M\u00fcller's (et al.) research of applying Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to fluid simulation - essentially simulating fluid as thousands of small particles, rather than the traditional Eularian grid-based approach.\n\nFeel free to email me and I'll tell you more about this project!\n\n## Using the Simulator ##\n\nFirstly, click & drag to rotate the scene using typical GLVU camera controls. You'll notice the simulation starts in a stopped state - you'll need to toggle the animation ON. Below are some keyboard controls.\n\n### Basic Controls ###\n\na -- Toggle the physics animation on/off (upon starting animation is OFF)  \n1 -- Load the \"Dam Break\" scenario (initial scenario)  \n2 -- Load the \"Cube\" scenario  \n3 -- Load the \"Faucet\" scenario  \nt -- Toggle tumble mode on/off (the water will react to the tilt of the camera)  \n\n### Advanced Controls ##\n  \ng -- Toggle grid visible (grid used for neighbor particle optimization)  \n/ -- Toggle gravity on/off  \ns -- Toggle coloring of surface purple (particles on the surface have a surface tension force applied)  \nf -- Output current FPS to stdout  \n\n\n## References ##\n\nParticle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications  \nMatthias M\u00fcller, David Charypar and Markus Gross  \nhttp://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/sca03.pdf  \n"}, "craftworkgames/FarseerPhysics.Portable": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "craftworkgames/FarseerPhysics.Portable", "diskUsage": 1204, "name": "FarseerPhysics.Portable", "owner": {"login": "craftworkgames"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C#"}]}, "createdAt": "2014-05-14T12:53:32Z", "pushedAt": "2015-12-20T23:51:59Z", "object": {"text": "FarseerPhysics.Portable\n=======================\n\nFarseer Physics compiled as a portable class library (PCL) against the PCL version of MonoGame.\n\nThis is a fork of the Farseer Physics Engine found on codeplex with a few minor changes to make it work as a Portable Class Library (PCL) with the PCL version of MonoGame.

If you're using an older version of Unity, navigate inside the *com.alexismorin.editorphysicssimulation* folder and then just drag the *Editor* folder you find there anywhere in your project hierarchy.\n\n\n\n"}, "openfl/box2d": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "openfl/box2d", "diskUsage": 266, "name": "box2d", "owner": {"login": "openfl"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Haxe"}, {"name": "ActionScript"}, {"name": "AngelScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2012-01-17T21:47:41Z", "pushedAt": "2020-02-11T18:56:20Z", "object": {"text": "[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE.md) [![Haxelib Version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/openfl/box2d.svg?style=flat&label=haxelib)](http://lib.haxe.org/p/box2d)\n\nBox2D\n=====\n\nThe Box2D rigid-body 2D physics engine, ported to Haxe from the Box2DFlash port by Boris the Brave.\n\nThe syntax has been updated to follow the standard Haxe convention, for example:\n\n**ActionScript**\n\n```as3\nvar world:b2World = new b2World (new b2Vec2 (0, 10.0), true);\nvar worldScale:int = 30;\n    \nvar body:b2BodyDef = new b2BodyDef ();\nbody.position.Set (250 / worldScale, 200 / worldScale);\nbody.type = b2Body.b2_dynamicBody;\n  \t\nvar circle:b2CircleShape = new b2CircleShape (10 / worldScale);\nvar fixture:b2FixtureDef = new b2FixtureDef ();\nfixture.shape = circle;\n  \t\nplayer = world.CreateBody (body);\nplayer.CreateFixture (fixture);\n```\n\nThe above ActionScript code would be written like this in Haxe:\n\n**Haxe**\n\n```haxe\nvar world = new B2World (new B2Vec2 (0, 10.0), true);\nvar worldScale = 30;\n    \nvar body = new B2BodyDef ();\nbody.position.set (250 / worldScale, 200 / worldScale);\nbody.type = DYNAMIC_BODY;\n    \nvar circle = new B2CircleShape (10 / worldScale);\nvar fixture = new B2FixtureDef ();\nfixture.shape = circle;\n    \nplayer = world.createBody (body);\nplayer.createFixture (fixture);\n```\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can easily install Box2D using haxelib:\n\n    haxelib install box2d\n\nTo add it to a Lime or OpenFL project, add this to your project file:\n\n    <haxelib name=\"box2d\" />\n\n\nDevelopment Builds\n==================\n\nClone the Box2D repository:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/openfl/box2d\n\nTell haxelib where your development copy of Box2D is installed:\n\n    haxelib dev box2d box2d\n\nTo return to release builds:\n\n    haxelib dev box2d\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 49, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "62bd924b8a19d635316d3a57a6e31f697db50707 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Joshua Granick"}, "pushedDate": "2020-01-24T19:52:14Z", "messageHeadline": "Update LICENSE.md", "message": "Update LICENSE.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Joshua Granick"}, "pushedDate": "2019-08-22T15:03:35Z", "messageHeadline": "Logic fix in B2Fixture (resolve #20)", "message": "Logic fix in B2Fixture (resolve #20)"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "amiani"}, "pushedDate": "2019-04-16T18:59:43Z", "messageHeadline": "changed B2Fixture SetUserData to setUserData", "message": "changed B2Fixture SetUserData to setUserData"}}, {"node": {"additions": 185, "author": {"name": "Zaphod"}, "pushedDate": "2018-11-05T18:29:40Z", "messageHeadline": "add heaps debug draw view", "message": "add heaps debug draw view"}}, {"node": {"additions": 76, "author": {"name": "Joshua Granick"}, "pushedDate": "2018-08-20T17:59:38Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge pull request #16 from randomnine/master", "message": "Merge pull request #16 from randomnine/master\n\nFix memory leaks"}}, {"node": {"additions": 11, "author": {"name": "Ruari O'Sullivan"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Null pointers when deallocating a body", "message": "Null pointers when deallocating a body"}}, {"node": {"additions": 41, "author": {"name": "Ruari O'Sullivan"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Fix memory leak in broad phase collision detection", "message": "Fix memory leak in broad phase collision detection\n\nFor some reason, garbage collection wasn't cleaning up this closure in certain builds.

Box2DFlash port by Boris the Brave.\n\nThe syntax has been updated to follow the standard Haxe convention, for example:\n\n**ActionScript**\n\n```as3\nvar world:b2World = new b2World (new b2Vec2 (0, 10.0), true);\nvar worldScale:int = 30;\n    \nvar body:b2BodyDef = new b2BodyDef ();\nbody.position.Set (250 / worldScale, 200 / worldScale);\nbody.type = b2Body.b2_dynamicBody;\n  \t\nvar circle:b2CircleShape = new b2CircleShape (10 / worldScale);\nvar fixture:b2FixtureDef = new b2FixtureDef ();\nfixture.shape = circle;\n  \t\nplayer = world.CreateBody (body);\nplayer.CreateFixture (fixture);\n```\n\nThe above ActionScript code would be written like this in Haxe:\n\n**Haxe**\n\n```haxe\nvar world = new B2World (new B2Vec2 (0, 10.0), true);\nvar worldScale = 30;\n    \nvar body =

second-ranked solution\n\nThis is a solution ranked second on the [Private Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/leaderboard) of the Kaggle [\"Flavours of Physics: Finding \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics) competition. The model is based on [gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) and implemented in Python with the help of the [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library. It is simply a combination of two XGBoost classifiers (boosters) trained on different sets of features. The first booster is an ensemble of 200 [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) targeting mostly geometric features (such as impact parameters and track isolation variables). The second booster consists of 100 trees trained on purely kinematic features. Final prediction is a weighted average of the probabilities predicted by the individual classifiers (with a weight of 0.78 assigned to the first booster). Combining two independent classifiers allows us to easily pass the [correlation test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/correlation-test). To pass the [agreement test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/agreement-test), the only thing needed is to exclude *SPDhits* from the features used in the training process.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* The [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library should be installed\n* The standard Python packages **numpy**, **pandas**, and **csv** are required\n* The training and test datasets (the files **training.csv** and **test.csv**) can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/data)\n\n## How to generate the solution\n\n 1. Put the data files **training.csv** and **test.csv** in the **data** directory.\n 2. To train the XGBoost classifiers, run **python train.py**. The trained boosters will be saved in the files **bst1.model** and **bst2.model**, so you can make predictions on new datasets without re-training the model.\n 3. To make a prediction, run **python predict.py**. Results will be written to **submission.csv**.\n\n## Feature engineering\n\nSome new features were designed in addition to the original ones. The original feature *SPDhits* was not used since it prevents passing the agreement test. Lists of the features used to train each booster are provided below.\n\n### Features for the first booster\n\n* **Original features:** *FlightDistance*, *FlightDistanceError*, *LifeTime*, *IP*, *IPSig*, *VertexChi2*, *dira*, *pt*, *DOCAone*, *DOCAtwo*, *DOCAthree*, *IP_p0p2*, *IP_p1p2*, *isolationa*, *isolationb*, *isolationc*, *isolationd*, *isolatione*, *isolationf*, *iso*, *CDF1*, *CDF2*, *CDF3*, *ISO_SumBDT*, *p0_IsoBDT*, *p1_IsoBDT*, *p2_IsoBDT*, *p0_track_Chi2Dof*, *p1_track_Chi2Dof*, *p2_track_Chi2Dof*, *p0_IP*, *p0_IPSig*, *p1_IP*, *p1_IPSig*, *p2_IP*, *p2_IPSig*.\n\n* **New features:**\n  * __*E*__ is the full energy of the mother particle calculated assuming that the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are muons (*E* = *E0* + *E1* + *E2*).\n  * __*FlightDistanceSig*__ is the ratio (*FlightDistance* / *FlightDistanceError*).\n  * __*DOCA_sum*__ is the sum (*DOCAone* + *DOCAtwo* + *DOCAthree*).\n  * __*isolation_sum*__ is the sum (*isolationa* + *isolationb* + *isolationc* + *isolationd* + *isolatione* + *isolationf*).\n  * __*IsoBDT_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IsoBDT* + *p1_IsoBDT* + *p2_IsoBDT*).\n  * __*track_Chi2Dof*__ is calculated as sqrt[(*p0_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2 + (*p1_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2 + (*p2_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2].\n  * __*IP_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IP* + *p1_IP* + *p2_IP*).\n  * __*IPSig_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IPSig* + *p1_IPSig* + *p2_IPSig*).\n  * __*CDF_sum*__ is the sum (*CDF1* + *CDF2* + *CDF3*).\n\n### Features for the second booster\n\n* **Original features:** *dira*, *pt*, *p0_pt*, *p0_p*, *p0_eta*, *p1_pt*, *p1_p*, *p1_eta*, *p2_pt*, *p2_p*, *p2_eta*.\n\n* **New features:**\n  * __*E*__ is the full energy of the mother particle calculated assuming that the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are muons (*E* = *E0* + *E1* + *E2*).\n  * __*pz*__ is the longitudinal momentum of the mother particle.\n  * __*beta*__ is the relativistic beta of the mother particle (*beta* = *v* / *c*).\n  * __*gamma*__ is the relativistic gamma of the mother particle (*gamma* = 1 / sqrt(1 \u2013 *beta*^2)).\n  * __*beta_gamma*__ is *beta*\u00d7*gamma* calculated as *FlightDistance* / (*LifeTime*\u00d7*c*), where *c* is the speed of light.\n  * __*Delta_E*__ is the difference between energies of the mother particle calculated in two different ways.\n  * __*Delta_M*__ is the difference between masses of the mother particle calculated in two different ways.\n  * __*flag_M*__ equals to 1 if the mass of the mother particle is close to the tau mass; equals to 0 otherwise. \n  * __*E0*__ is the full energy of the particle p0 calculated as *E0* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p0_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E1*__ is the full energy of the particle p1 calculated as *E1* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p1_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E2*__ is the full energy of the particle p2 calculated as *E2* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p2_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E0_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E0* / *E*).\n  * __*E1_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E1* / *E*).\n  * __*E2_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E2* / *E*).\n  * __*p0_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p0_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*p1_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p1_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*p2_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p2_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*eta_01*__ is the difference (*p0_eta* \u2013 *p1_eta*).\n  * __*eta_02*__ is the difference (*p0_eta* \u2013 *p2_eta*).\n  * __*eta_12*__ is the difference (*p1_eta* \u2013 *p2_eta*).\n  * __*t_coll*__ is calculated as (*p0_pt* + *p1_pt* + *p2_pt*) / *pt* (this equals to unity if the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are collinear in the transverse plane).\n\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 10, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor":

Kaggle's Flavours of Physics: the second-ranked solution\n\nThis is a solution ranked second on the [Private Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/leaderboard) of the Kaggle [\"Flavours of Physics: Finding \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics) competition. The model is based on [gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) and implemented in Python with the help of the [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library. It is simply a combination of two XGBoost classifiers (boosters) trained on different sets of features. The first booster is an ensemble of 200 [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) targeting mostly geometric features (such as impact parameters and track isolation variables). The second booster consists of 100 trees trained on purely kinematic features. Final prediction is a weighted average of the probabilities predicted by the individual classifiers (with a weight of 0.78 assigned to the first booster). Combining two independent classifiers allows us to easily pass the [correlation test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/correlation-test). To pass the [agreement test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/agreement-test), the only thing needed is to exclude *SPDhits* from the features used in the training process.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* The [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library should be installed\n* The standard Python packages **numpy**, **pandas**, and **csv** are required\n* The training and test datasets (the files **training.csv** and **test.csv**) can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/data)\n\n## How to generate the solution\n\n 1. Put the data files **training.csv** and **test.csv** in the **data** directory.\n 2. To train the XGBoost classifiers, run **python train.py**. The trained boosters will be saved in the files **bst1.model** and **bst2.model**, so you can make predictions on new datasets without re-training the model.\n 3. To make a prediction, run **python predict.py**. Results will be written to **submission.csv**.\n\n## Feature engineering\n\nSome new features were designed in addition to the original ones. The original feature *SPDhits* was not used since it prevents passing the agreement test. Lists of the features used to train each booster are provided below.\n\n### Features for the first booster\n\n* **Original features:** *FlightDistance*, *FlightDistanceError*, *LifeTime*, *IP*, *IPSig*, *VertexChi2*, *dira*, *pt*, *DOCAone*, *DOCAtwo*, *DOCAthree*, *IP_p0p2*, *IP_p1p2*, *isolationa*, *isolationb*, *isolationc*, *isolationd*, *isolatione*, *isolationf*, *iso*, *CDF1*, *CDF2*, *CDF3*, *ISO_SumBDT*, *p0_IsoBDT*, *p1_IsoBDT*, *p2_IsoBDT*, *p0_track_Chi2Dof*, *p1_track_Chi2Dof*, *p2_track_Chi2Dof*, *p0_IP*, *p0_IPSig*, *p1_IP*, *p1_IPSig*, *p2_IP*, *p2_IPSig*.\n\n* **New features:**\n  * __*E*__ is the full energy of the mother particle calculated assuming that the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are muons (*E* = *E0* + *E1* + *E2*).\n  * __*FlightDistanceSig*__ is the ratio (*FlightDistance* / *FlightDistanceError*).\n  * __*DOCA_sum*__ is the sum (*DOCAone* + *DOCAtwo* + *DOCAthree*).\n  * __*isolation_sum*__ is the sum (*isolationa* + *isolationb* + *isolationc* + *isolationd* + *isolatione* + *isolationf*).\n  * __*IsoBDT_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IsoBDT* + *p1_IsoBDT* + *p2_IsoBDT*).\n  * __*track_Chi2Dof*__ is calculated as sqrt[(*p0_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2 + (*p1_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2 + (*p2_track_Chi2Dof* \u2013 1)^2].\n  * __*IP_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IP* + *p1_IP* + *p2_IP*).\n  * __*IPSig_sum*__ is the sum (*p0_IPSig* + *p1_IPSig* + *p2_IPSig*).\n  * __*CDF_sum*__ is the sum (*CDF1* + *CDF2* + *CDF3*).\n\n### Features for the second booster\n\n* **Original features:** *dira*, *pt*, *p0_pt*, *p0_p*, *p0_eta*, *p1_pt*, *p1_p*, *p1_eta*, *p2_pt*, *p2_p*, *p2_eta*.\n\n* **New features:**\n  * __*E*__ is the full energy of the mother particle calculated assuming that the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are muons (*E* = *E0* + *E1* + *E2*).\n  * __*pz*__ is the longitudinal momentum of the mother particle.\n  * __*beta*__ is the relativistic beta of the mother particle (*beta* = *v* / *c*).\n  * __*gamma*__ is the relativistic gamma of the mother particle (*gamma* = 1 / sqrt(1 \u2013 *beta*^2)).\n  * __*beta_gamma*__ is *beta*\u00d7*gamma* calculated as *FlightDistance* / (*LifeTime*\u00d7*c*), where *c* is the speed of light.\n  * __*Delta_E*__ is the difference between energies of the mother particle calculated in two different ways.\n  * __*Delta_M*__ is the difference between masses of the mother particle calculated in two different ways.\n  * __*flag_M*__ equals to 1 if the mass of the mother particle is close to the tau mass; equals to 0 otherwise. \n  * __*E0*__ is the full energy of the particle p0 calculated as *E0* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p0_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E1*__ is the full energy of the particle p1 calculated as *E1* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p1_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E2*__ is the full energy of the particle p2 calculated as *E2* = sqrt[(*m_mu*)^2 + (*p2_p*)^2], where *m_mu* is the muon mass.\n  * __*E0_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E0* / *E*).\n  * __*E1_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E1* / *E*).\n  * __*E2_ratio*__ is the ratio (*E2* / *E*).\n  * __*p0_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p0_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*p1_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p1_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*p2_pt_ratio*__ is the ratio (*p2_pt* / *pt*).\n  * __*eta_01*__ is the difference (*p0_eta* \u2013 *p1_eta*).\n  * __*eta_02*__ is the difference (*p0_eta* \u2013 *p2_eta*).\n  * __*eta_12*__ is the difference (*p1_eta* \u2013 *p2_eta*).\n  * __*t_coll*__ is calculated as (*p0_pt* + *p1_pt* + *p2_pt*) / *pt* (this equals to unity if the final-state particles p0, p1, and p2 are collinear in the transverse plane).\n\n"}, "pissang/qtek-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "pissang/qtek-physics", "diskUsage": 5909, "name":

Erin Catto, the author of the original software, was not involved in the port.\n\nhttps://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bytearena-public/ba-prod-twitter.mp4\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe kept the source code as close to the C++ as we possibly could. So the documentation you'll find on Box2D is relevant.\n\nhttps://box2d.org/documentation/\n\n## API changes\n\nThe API had to change a tiny bit due to the fact that :\n\n* Go has no constructors as a language feature, thus code for constructors has been placed in `Make$NAME_OF_TYPE` functions\n* Go has no support for function overloading; some functions implemented multiple times for different sets of parameters under the same name in C++ are distinguished by name in the golang version; we tried to make names explicit so that should not be an issue\n* Go has no support for operator overloading; this C++ feature is used extensively throughout the C++ version of Box2D (mainly for the vector and matrix arithmethic), and has been converted to good old, albeit verbose function calls\n\n## Tests\n\nNo opengl testbed for the moment.\n\nOur tests verify the output of position and rotation of bodies over time against those generared by the C++ reference.\n\nRight now, there's a test (passing) checking all the supported body shape collisions in `cmd/test-character-collision`.\n\n## Usage example\n\nHave a look at `cpp_compliance_test.go`.\n\n## License of the original Box2D (C++)\n\nThe original Box2D is developed by Erin Catto, and has the zlib license. Thank you Erin for this incredible piece of software.\n\n## License of this port (Go)\n\nBox2D.go is developed by ByteArena (https://github.com/bytearena), and has the zlib license. While the zlib license does not require acknowledgement, we encourage you to give credit to Box2D.go in your product.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 41, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage":

port of Box2D (https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D), a 2D physics engine for games written in C++ by Erin Catto.\n\nThe port is complete and based on the latest Box2D commit as of 2017-09-20 (https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D/commit/f655c603ba9d83f07fc566d38d2654ba35739102)\n\n## Who did this ?\n\nThe ByteArena team did. Erin Catto, the author of the original software, was not involved in the port.\n\nhttps://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bytearena-public/ba-prod-twitter.mp4\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe kept the source code as close to the C++ as we possibly could. So the documentation you'll find on Box2D is relevant.\n\nhttps://box2d.org/documentation/\n\n## API changes\n\nThe API had to change a tiny bit due to the fact that :\n\n* Go has no constructors as a language feature, thus code for constructors has been placed in `Make$NAME_OF_TYPE` functions\n* Go has no support for function overloading; some functions implemented multiple times for different sets of parameters under the same name in C++ are distinguished by name in the golang version; we tried to make names explicit so that should not be an issue\n* Go has no support for operator overloading; this C++ feature is used extensively throughout the C++ version of Box2D (mainly for the vector and matrix arithmethic), and has been converted to good old, albeit verbose function calls\n\n## Tests\n\nNo opengl testbed for the moment.\n\nOur tests verify the output of position and rotation of bodies over time against those generared by the C++ reference.\n\nRight now, there's a test (passing) checking all the supported body shape collisions in `cmd/test-character-collision`.\n\n## Usage example\n\nHave a look at `cpp_compliance_test.go`.\n\n## License of the original Box2D (C++)\n\nThe original Box2D is developed by Erin Catto, and has the zlib license. Thank you Erin for this incredible piece of software.\n\n## License of this port (Go)\n\nBox2D.go is developed by ByteArena (https://github.com/bytearena), and has the zlib license. While the zlib license does not require acknowledgement, we encourage you to give credit to Box2D.go in your product.\n"}, "Ostkaka/physicsmultiplay": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Ostkaka/physicsmultiplay", "diskUsage": 1306, "name": "physicsmultiplay", "owner": {"login": "Ostkaka"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "JavaScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2013-01-07T20:10:38Z", "pushedAt": "2013-01-12T13:34:04Z", "object": {"text": "# Physics multiplayer demo\n\nThis is simple a demo for a multiplayer physics playground based on \n[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js),\n and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\nThe scene features multi-user interactions such as:\n\n * Object spawning (boxes and spheres).\n * Mouse picking (Pick and throw objects around with the mouse).\n * Apply a point gravity field.\n * Chat with other players\n\nServer-client communication is done using WebSockets with packets in JSON text-format. Simulation is done serverside only, while clients handle rendering.\n\n[Live demo at nodejitsu](http://pmb.jit.su/)\n\n### Installation and Usage\n\nTo install, clone the repository and do:\n\n    apt-get install nodejs\n    cd physicsmultiplay\n    npm install\n    node cannon_server.js\n\npoint your browser to the IP and enter a name.\n\nNote: to change the default port 80, you have to change it in both cannon_server.js and cannon_client.js.\n\n\n![.](http://content.screencast.com/users/dirkk1/folders/Jing/media/04ebcfa3-0870-4fc7-acfc-f954a0bba492/00000090.png)\n\n## Ideas and Todos\n* Support convex shapes. Teapots and rabbits mandatory.\n* Send update of an entity to clients only if it has been changed.\n* Improved mouse-pick rendering. Link between points in constraint.\n* Render mouse picks of other clients.\n* Binary packets instead of text.\n* Limit number of players.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 22, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "201e8cbc4dd55c6afa61ad91d973cc8ec713f7d2 21"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Ostkaka"}, "pushedDate": "2013-01-12T13:34:05Z", "messageHeadline": "worng commit. going back.", "message": "worng commit. going back."}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Ostkaka"}, "pushedDate": "2013-01-12T13:30:42Z", "messageHeadline": "made some changes to renderer.

Status](https://travis-ci.org/liabru/matter-attractors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liabru/matter-attractors)\n\nThis plugin makes it easy to apply continual forces on bodies.\nIt's possible to simulate effects such as wind, \n[gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation) and \n[magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism).\n\n## Demo\n\nSee the [demo](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors).\n\n[![matter-attractors](docs/demo.gif)](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors)\n\n## Install\n\nGet the [matter-attractors.js](build/matter-attractors.js) file directly or get it via npm:\n\n    npm install matter-attractors\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nMatter.use('matter-attractors');\n// or\nMatter.use(MatterAttractors);\n```\n\nSee [Using Plugins](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Using-plugins#using-plugins) for more information.\n\n### Custom attractors\n\nAttractors are just functions that are pushed to `body.plugin.attractors`.\nAn attractor function accepts two bodies `bodyA` and `bodyB`, where `bodyA` is \nalways the attracting body and `bodyB` is the body being attracted.\n\nThe attractor will be called against every other body in the engine in the place of `bodyB`,\non every engine update. If a force is returned, it will be applied to `bodyB` only.\n\n#### Basic usage\n\nAn example of a body that attracts other bodies to it:\n\n```js\nvar body = Matter.Bodies.circle(0, 0, 10, {\n  plugin: {\n    attractors: [\n      function(bodyA, bodyB) {\n        return {\n          x: (bodyA.position.x - bodyB.position.x) * 1e-6,\n          y: (bodyA.position.y - bodyB.position.y) * 1e-6,\n        };\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIt's possible here to use collision filters too if needed, by using [Detector.canCollide](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Detector.html#method_canCollide)\nand returning `null` to skip the pair.\n\n#### Advance usage\n\nIn advance usage, e.g. where forces apply to both bodies, instead of returning the force it can instead \nbe applied manually to both bodies inside the function using `Body.applyForce`.\n\n```js\nvar body = Matter.Bodies.circle(0, 0, 10, {\n  plugin: {\n    attractors: [\n      function(bodyA, bodyB) {\n        var force = {\n          x: (bodyA.position.x - bodyB.position.x) * 1e-6,\n          y: (bodyA.position.y - bodyB.position.y) * 1e-6,\n        };\n\n        // apply force to both bodies\n        Body.applyForce(bodyA, bodyA.position, Matter.Vector.neg(force));\n        Body.applyForce(bodyB, bodyB.position, force);\n      }\n

"readme_text": "# matter-attractors\n\n> An attractors plugin for [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liabru/matter-attractors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liabru/matter-attractors)\n\nThis plugin makes it easy to apply continual forces on bodies.\nIt's possible to simulate effects such as wind, \n[gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation) and \n[magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism).\n\n## Demo\n\nSee the [demo](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors).\n\n[![matter-attractors](docs/demo.gif)](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors)\n\n## Install\n\nGet the [matter-attractors.js](build/matter-attractors.js) file directly or get it via npm:\n\n    npm install matter-attractors\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/)\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nMatter.use('matter-attractors');\n// or\nMatter.use(MatterAttractors);\n```\n\nSee [Using Plugins](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Using-plugins#using-plugins) for more information.\n\n### Custom attractors\n\nAttractors are just functions that are pushed to `body.plugin.attractors`.\nAn attractor function accepts two bodies `bodyA` and `bodyB`, where `bodyA` is \nalways the attracting body and `bodyB` is the body being attracted.\n\nThe attractor will be called against every other body in the engine in the place of `bodyB`,\non every engine update. If a force is returned, it will be applied to `bodyB` only.\n\n#### Basic usage\n\nAn example of a body that attracts other bodies to it:\n\n```js\nvar body = Matter.Bodies.circle(0, 0, 10, {\n  plugin: {\n    attractors: [\n      function(bodyA, bodyB) {\n        return {\n          x: (bodyA.position.x - bodyB.position.x) * 1e-6,\n          y: (bodyA.position.y - bodyB.position.y) * 1e-6,\n        };\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIt's possible here to use collision filters too if needed, by using [Detector.canCollide](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Detector.html#method_canCollide)\nand returning `null` to skip the pair.\n\n#### Advance usage\n\nIn advance usage, e.g. where forces apply to both bodies, instead of returning the force it can instead \nbe applied manually to both bodies inside the function using `Body.applyForce`.\n\n```js\nvar body = Matter.Bodies.circle(0, 0, 10, {\n  plugin: {\n    attractors: [\n      function(bodyA, bodyB) {\n        var force = {\n          x: (bodyA.position.x - bodyB.position.x) * 1e-6,\n          y: (bodyA.position.y - bodyB.position.y) * 1e-6,\n        };\n\n        // apply force to both bodies\n        Body.applyForce(bodyA, bodyA.position, Matter.Vector.neg(force));\n        Body.applyForce(bodyB, bodyB.position, force);\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Built in attractors\n\nThere are some attractors you can push to `body.plugin.attractors`:\n\n- `MatterAttractors.Attractors.gravity` - uses Newton's gravitational laws to apply an attractive force on both bodies\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [API docs](API.md).\n\n## Examples\n\nCheck out the [examples](docs/examples) or try them out first:\n\n- [Basic](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors#basic)\n- [Gravity](http://liabru.github.io/matter-attractors#gravity)\n"}, "faha223/PhysicsEngine": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "faha223/PhysicsEngine", "diskUsage": 232, "name": "PhysicsEngine", "owner": {"login": "faha223"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C++"}, {"name": "C"}, {"name": "Makefile"}]}, "createdAt": "2014-01-01T15:42:36Z", "pushedAt": "2014-12-07T00:22:44Z", "object": {"text": "PhysicsEngine\n=============\n\nAn Object-Oriented Physics Engine that abstracts the PhysX (and maybe eventually Havok) API\n\nCompilation:\n\n  This project requires access to the Nvidia PhysX SDK version 3.3.0\n  \n  To compile, open the project in VS2013 and edit the Include and Lib folders to include the\n  locations of your PhysX SDK Include and Lib folders.\n  \n  Then just build and run.\n  \nAdditional Info:\n\n  This project includes a driver.cpp which creates an SDL window in which to demonstrate the\n  physics engine using OpenGL.\n  \n  This project was built using C++11 standards for timing and multithreading so it is\n  exception safe and portable. \n  \nFuture Work:\n  \n  This is in its early alpha stages, and as such does not actually support any primitives yet.\n  That is the next thing I need to implement.

Check the docs for your editor to learn more.\n\n\n**3:** For **Android** Make sure to add this line `android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"` in your `<project-directory>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` under `application` like this.\n```xml\n<application\n       android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\">\n</application>\n```\n\nand permissions\n\n```xml\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\" />\n```\n\nFor **iOS** add following code in your `<project-directory>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`\n```plist\n\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n  \n  <dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key> <true/>\n  </dict>\n\n<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key> <true/> \n```\n\n**4:** Now in your Dart code, you can use:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_tex/flutter_tex.dart'; \n```\n\n**5:** Now you can use TeXHTML widget like this.\n```dart\n    TeXView(\n          teXHTML: r\"\"\"$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$<br> \"\"\",\n          renderingEngine: RenderingEngine.Katex,  // Katex for fast render and MathJax for quality render.\n          onRenderFinished: (height) {\n                print(\"Widget Height is : $height\");\n                },   \n          onPageFinished: (string) {\n                print(\"Page Loading finished\");\n              },\n          webAppDomain: \"https://flutter-tex.web.app\", //Your Web Application Domain e.g. \"https://flutter-tex.web.app\" Keep it null while development put your domain only when you are deploying your application to a server.\n\n        )\n```\n\nUse **Katex RenderingEngine** for fast render and  **MathJax RenderingEngine** for quality render.\n\n# Api Usage.\n- `teXHTML:` Raw String containing HTML and TEX Code e.g.<br>\n    ```\n \n    String textHTML = r\"\"\"\n    <style>\n     #myDiv \n     {\n     background-color: red;\n     }\n    </style>\n    \n    <div id='myDiv'>\n        $$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$\n    </div>\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n    You can also put javascript code in it.<br>\n    \n    If you load **Network Image** in your document you should go like this.\n    \n    ``` \n    <img onload=\"RenderedWebViewHeight.postMessage(document.getElementById('teXHTML').clientHeight);\"\n    src=\"https://img.wallpapersafari.com/desktop/1920/1080/84/27/nMWzIB.jpg\" />\n    ```\n  Do put this<br>\n  ```onload=\"RenderedWebViewHeight.postMessage(document.getElementById('teXHTML').clientHeight);\"```<br>\n  in your img tag, it'll recalculate the height of the page and rerender the page after the image loading completes.\n\n- `renderingEngine:` Render Engine to render TeX (Default is Katex Rendering Engine).\n  \n- `height:` Fixed Height for TeXView. (Avoid using fixed height for TeXView, let it to adopt the height by itself)\n  \n- `loadingWidget:` Show a loading widget before rendering completes.\n  \n- `onTap:` On Tap Callback.\n\n- `onRenderFinished:` Callback with the rendered page height, when TEX rendering finishes.\n  \n- `onPageFinished:` Callback when TeXView loading finishes.\n  \n- `keepAlive:` Keep widget Alive . (True by default).\n\n\n# Demo app is available on Google Play.\n<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shahxad.flutter_tex_example&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>\n\n[Example Application Source](https://github.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/tree/master/example)\n\n# Screenshots\n\nScreenshot# 01             |  Screenshot# 02\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_1.png\"/> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_2.png\"/>\n\nScreenshot# 03             |  Screenshot# 04\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_3.png\"/> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_4.png\"/>\n\n## To Do:\n- ~~Speed Optimizations as it's a bit slow rendering speed. It takes 1-2 seconds to render after application loaded.~~ (Solved by adding Katex Support)\n- Beta support for Flutter Web, Automatically calculation of TeXView Height in Flutter Web and much more to do for Flutter Web.\n\n## Cautions:\n- Please avoid using too many TeXViews in a single page, because this is based on [webview_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webview_flutter) a complete web browser. Which may cause to slow down your app.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 45, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "baf78ab9a1dc9b7048d15eedb12046b96b5d86c3 24"},

"# Flutter TeX\n\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/shah-xad/flutter_tex?style=social)](https://github.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/stargazers) [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_tex.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tex)\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/example/assets/flutter_tex_banner.png\"/>\n\nA Flutter Package to render so many types of equations based on **LaTeX**, most commonly used are as followings:\n\n- **Mathematics / Maths Equations** (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Geometry etc...)\n\n- **Physics Equations**\n\n- **Signal Processing Equations**\n\n- **Chemistry Equations**\n\n- **Statistics / Stats Equations**\n\n- It also includes full **HTML** with **JavaScript** support.\n\nRendering of equations depends on [mini-mathjax](https://github.com/electricbookworks/mini-mathjax) a simplified version of [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/) and [Katex](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) JavaScript libraries.\n\nThis package mainly depends on [webview_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webview_flutter) plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Use this package as a library in your flutter Application\n\n**1:** Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter_tex: ^3.1.4+1\n```\n\n\n**2:** You can install packages from the command line:\n\n```bash\n$ flutter packages get\n```\n\nAlternatively, your editor might support flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.\n\n\n**3:** For **Android** Make sure to add this line `android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"` in your `<project-directory>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` under `application` like this.\n```xml\n<application\n       android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\">\n</application>\n```\n\nand permissions\n\n```xml\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\" />\n```\n\nFor **iOS** add following code in your `<project-directory>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`\n```plist\n\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n  \n  <dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key> <true/>\n  </dict>\n\n<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key> <true/> \n```\n\n**4:** Now in your Dart code, you can use:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_tex/flutter_tex.dart'; \n```\n\n**5:** Now you can use TeXHTML widget like this.\n```dart\n    TeXView(\n          teXHTML: r\"\"\"$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$<br> \"\"\",\n          renderingEngine: RenderingEngine.Katex,  // Katex for fast render and MathJax for quality render.\n          onRenderFinished: (height) {\n                print(\"Widget Height is : $height\");\n                },   \n          onPageFinished: (string) {\n                print(\"Page Loading finished\");\n              },\n          webAppDomain: \"https://flutter-tex.web.app\", //Your Web Application Domain e.g. \"https://flutter-tex.web.app\" Keep it null while development put your domain only when you are deploying your application to a server.\n\n        )\n```\n\nUse **Katex RenderingEngine** for fast render and  **MathJax RenderingEngine** for quality render.\n\n# Api Usage.\n- `teXHTML:` Raw String containing HTML and TEX Code e.g.<br>\n    ```\n \n    String textHTML = r\"\"\"\n    <style>\n     #myDiv \n     {\n     background-color: red;\n     }\n    </style>\n    \n    <div id='myDiv'>\n        $$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$\n    </div>\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n    You can also put javascript code in it.<br>\n    \n    If you load **Network Image** in your document you should go like this.\n    \n    ``` \n    <img onload=\"RenderedWebViewHeight.postMessage(document.getElementById('teXHTML').clientHeight);\"\n    src=\"https://img.wallpapersafari.com/desktop/1920/1080/84/27/nMWzIB.jpg\" />\n    ```\n  Do put this<br>\n  ```onload=\"RenderedWebViewHeight.postMessage(document.getElementById('teXHTML').clientHeight);\"```<br>\n  in your img tag, it'll recalculate the height of the page and rerender the page after the image loading completes.\n\n- `renderingEngine:` Render Engine to render TeX (Default is Katex Rendering Engine).\n  \n- `height:` Fixed Height for TeXView. (Avoid using fixed height for TeXView, let it to adopt the height by itself)\n  \n- `loadingWidget:` Show a loading widget before rendering completes.\n  \n- `onTap:` On Tap Callback.\n\n- `onRenderFinished:` Callback with the rendered page height, when TEX rendering finishes.\n  \n- `onPageFinished:` Callback when TeXView loading finishes.\n  \n- `keepAlive:` Keep widget Alive . (True by default).\n\n\n# Demo app is available on Google Play.\n<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shahxad.flutter_tex_example&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>\n\n[Example Application Source](https://github.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/tree/master/example)\n\n# Screenshots\n\nScreenshot# 01             |  Screenshot# 02\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_1.png\"/> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_2.png\"/>\n\nScreenshot# 03             |  Screenshot# 04\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_3.png\"/> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shah-xad/flutter_tex/master/screenshots/screenshot_4.png\"/>\n\n## To Do:\n- ~~Speed Optimizations as it's a bit slow rendering speed. It takes 1-2 seconds to render after application loaded.~~ (Solved by adding Katex Support)\n- Beta support for Flutter Web, Automatically calculation of TeXView Height in Flutter Web and much more to do for Flutter Web.\n\n## Cautions:\n- Please avoid using too many TeXViews in a single page, because this is based on [webview_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webview_flutter) a complete web browser. Which may cause to slow down your app.\n"}, "DanielSank/vankampen-stochastic": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "DanielSank/vankampen-stochastic", "diskUsage": 34, "name": "vankampen-stochastic", "owner": {"login": "DanielSank"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "TeX"}, {"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2015-11-10T08:45:38Z", "pushedAt": "2018-10-28T18:30:28Z", "object": {"text": "### Goal\n\nDo all the problems in N.G.

Here we introduce the interaction network, a\nmodel which can reason about how objects in complex systems interact, supporting\ndynamical predictions, as well as inferences about the abstract properties of the\nsystem.\"\nFrom the paper\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/interaction_net.PNG)\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/interaction_net_2.PNG)\n\nN-body Simulation\n--------------------\n\n`\npython interaction_network.py\n`\n\n### Data\nData are gathered from implemented physics engine (physics_engine.py), which by using given the number of objects initializes and processes random weights[0.2-9kg], distance[10-100m] and angle[0-360] same as the paper settings.\nOrbit system is implemented 0-th really big object in central (100kg, same to paper), and velocities of other objects are initialized as supporting stable status.\nObject state values of non-orbit system are randomly initialzed as above.\n\nBefore traing that, the data (not label!) is initialized as bellowed (same to the paper).\nmedian value is going to 0, and 5% and 95% data are going to -1 and 1, respectively.\nThis initialization is processed differently for mass, positions and velocities.\n\n### Settings\nAlmost settings are same to the paper, which is clearly written for that except bellowed. \n\nFor state, there no description, and I used 5-D vector [mass,x_position,y_position,x_velocity,y_velocity].\nFor R_a and X, there are no description for n-body test, thus I used zero-array with D_R=1, D_X=1.\nFor D_P, descriptions in page 6 are different, (for f_O, D_P=2, and for \\phi_A, D_P=10) in my implementation, I used D_P=2 (x and y velocities).\n(I checked that with 1st Author of this paper, Peter W. Battaglia, D_P is used as 10 for estimating potiential energy, and 2 for estimating next state.)\nFor b_k, descriptions in implementation is to concatenate OR_r and OR_s, however in model architecture, that is described to difference vector between them. In my implementation, I used difference vector.\nFor input of function a, descriptions in implementation is to object matrix O, however in model architecture, that is described to just use velocities as input. In my implementation, I just used velocities as input.\n\nExcept above three things, other settings are same to paper as followed.\n\nFor \\phi_R function, 4 hidden layers MLP with 150 nodes, ReLU activation function for hidden layers, linear ones for output layer and D_E=50 settings are used.\nFor \\phi_O function, 1 hidden layers MLP with 100 nodes, ReLU for hidden layer, linear for output layer and D_P=2 settings are used.\nAdam Optimizer is used with 0.001 learning rate.\nL2-regularization is used for matrix E and all parameters (lambda values for each regularization are 0.001).\n\nI generated 10 samples, which have 1000 frames, and 90%/10% data are used for training and validation. Max epoch is 40,000. For qualititive measure, I newly generated 1 sample and made video files for preidiction from model and true ones.\n\nI did not use Random noise when traning and balancing in batch.\n\n### Results\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/gravity_object_2.PNG)\n\nThe experiments are 2-object,3-object and 6-object ones.\n\nAbove MSE graph is 2-object experiment one.\n\nThe validation velocities MSE has been saturated to about 0.2~0.3,10 and 20,000 for 2-object, 3-object and 6-object, and video generated new data (not training ones!) is quitely good.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 29, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "2e1a3ee5bef8ace14630e0ed8f9714f40edbba38 24"}, "edges": [{"node":

r1.2.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00222\n\n\"Reasoning about objects, relations, and physics is central to human intelligence, and\na key goal of artificial intelligence. Here we introduce the interaction network, a\nmodel which can reason about how objects in complex systems interact, supporting\ndynamical predictions, as well as inferences about the abstract properties of the\nsystem.\"\nFrom the paper\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/interaction_net.PNG)\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/interaction_net_2.PNG)\n\nN-body Simulation\n--------------------\n\n`\npython interaction_network.py\n`\n\n### Data\nData are gathered from implemented physics engine (physics_engine.py), which by using given the number of objects initializes and processes random weights[0.2-9kg], distance[10-100m] and angle[0-360] same as the paper settings.\nOrbit system is implemented 0-th really big object in central (100kg, same to paper), and velocities of other objects are initialized as supporting stable status.\nObject state values of non-orbit system are randomly initialzed as above.\n\nBefore traing that, the data (not label!) is initialized as bellowed (same to the paper).\nmedian value is going to 0, and 5% and 95% data are going to -1 and 1, respectively.\nThis initialization is processed differently for mass, positions and velocities.\n\n### Settings\nAlmost settings are same to the paper, which is clearly written for that except bellowed. \n\nFor state, there no description, and I used 5-D vector [mass,x_position,y_position,x_velocity,y_velocity].\nFor R_a and X, there are no description for n-body test, thus I used zero-array with D_R=1, D_X=1.\nFor D_P, descriptions in page 6 are different, (for f_O, D_P=2, and for \\phi_A, D_P=10) in my implementation, I used D_P=2 (x and y velocities).\n(I checked that with 1st Author of this paper, Peter W. Battaglia, D_P is used as 10 for estimating potiential energy, and 2 for estimating next state.)\nFor b_k, descriptions in implementation is to concatenate OR_r and OR_s, however in model architecture, that is described to difference vector between them. In my implementation, I used difference vector.\nFor input of function a, descriptions in implementation is to object matrix O, however in model architecture, that is described to just use velocities as input. In my implementation, I just used velocities as input.\n\nExcept above three things, other settings are same to paper as followed.\n\nFor \\phi_R function, 4 hidden layers MLP with 150 nodes, ReLU activation function for hidden layers, linear ones for output layer and D_E=50 settings are used.\nFor \\phi_O function, 1 hidden layers MLP with 100 nodes, ReLU for hidden layer, linear for output layer and D_P=2 settings are used.\nAdam Optimizer is used with 0.001 learning rate.\nL2-regularization is used for matrix E and all parameters (lambda values for each regularization are 0.001).\n\nI generated 10 samples, which have 1000 frames, and 90%/10% data are used for training and validation. Max epoch is 40,000. For qualititive measure, I newly generated 1 sample and made video files for preidiction from model and true ones.\n\nI did not use Random noise when traning and balancing in batch.\n\n### Results\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jaesik817/Interaction-networks_tensorflow/blob/master/figures/gravity_object_2.PNG)\n\nThe experiments are 2-object,3-object and 6-object ones.\n\nAbove MSE graph is 2-object experiment one.\n\nThe validation velocities MSE has been saturated to about 0.2~0.3,10 and 20,000 for 2-object, 3-object and 6-object, and video generated new data (not training ones!) is quitely good.\n"}, "flashhawk/Simple-Physics-Particle": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "flashhawk/Simple-Physics-Particle", "diskUsage": 1178, "name": "Simple-Physics-Particle", "owner": {"login": "flashhawk"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "ActionScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2010-08-25T05:23:58Z", "pushedAt": "2012-10-20T15:12:50Z", "object": {"text": "Simple Physics Particle \n=============\nSimple Physics Particle engine is a simple to use AS3 particle system, suitable for beginners, very easy to use.

It's simple and there are literate comments throughout.\n\n## Why?\n\nIf it can be swiped, thrown or dragged, it should be a spring. If you want\nrealistic physical interactions, you need to model physics.\n\nCSS animations are bounded by a fixed time and use Bezier curves to describe\nanimation easing.\n\n    .animated {\n      transition: left 500ms cubic-bezier(0.000, 0.405, 0.000, 1.285);\n    }\n\nThis approach has a couple of problems:\n\n* When resources become scarce, browsers have to drop animation frames to make\nsure they deliver an animation on-time.

Features such as an intuitive and easy to learn graphical user\r\ninterface (GUI), a complete library of grid generation, and\r\npostprocessing functions, as well as command line interface (CLI)\r\nprogramming, and interactive and interpreted programming and scripting\r\ncapabilities, makes _FEATool_ suitable for everyone from students\r\nlearning mathematical modeling, to professionals and engineers wishing\r\nto explore new ideas in a simple, fast, and convenient way.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI)\r\n- Fully integrated and built-in pre-processing, CAD tools, automatic\r\n  mesh generation, solvers, post-processing, and visualization\r\n  functionality\r\n- Pre-defined physics modes and equations for heat and mass transfer,\r\n  fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, and\r\n  classical PDE\r\n- Support for custom user-defined equations and PDEs\r\n- Built-in expression parser (enter equations and coefficients _just\r\n  as writing on paper_ without any programming)\r\n- Easy to define fully coupled multiphysics problems\r\n- One-click interfaces for the OpenFOAM\u00ae, SU2, FEniCS, and Firedrake\r\n  external solvers\r\n- Save and export models in binary file format or editable script\r\n  files (every GUI operation is recorded to a corresponding MATLAB\r\n  function call)\r\n- Fully scriptable and programmable with the MATLAB scripting language\r\n  (including support for integration and embedding in custom\r\n  applications and toolboxes)\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe _FEATool Multiphysics_ Toolbox can either be used stand-alone as a\r\nfully integrated simulation GUI, or together with MATLAB enabling\r\ncommand line (CLI) use and scripting. In order to use the _FEATool\r\nMultiphysics_ toolbox, the program files must first be installed on the\r\nintended computer system. Please follow the procedure below for the\r\ncorresponding stand-alone or MATLAB toolbox installation modes. Note\r\nthat it is recommended to first uninstall older versions of _FEATool_\r\nbefore updating to a newer version.\r\n\r\n\r\nStand-alone Toolbox\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFEATool Multiphysics has been compiled to run in stand-alone mode\r\ntogether with the freely available MCR runtime (does not require\r\nMATLAB). Stand-alone mode is supported for 64-bit Windows systems (and\r\nvirtual machines VMs) with 4 GB or more RAM memory.\r\n\r\nTo install, download the installer from link below and run it. The\r\ninstaller will automatically download and install the correct MCR\r\nruntime engine (>=1 GB file size) and then install the FEATool\r\nexecutable. Click on the FEATool icon after the installation has been\r\ncompleted to start the toolbox.<br><br>\r\n\r\n[![FEATool Multiphysics - Stand-Alone Toolbox Download](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/multiphysics/files/1.11.1/FEATool_Multiphysics_webinstaller.exe/download)<br>\r\n\r\nPlease note that as the MCR runtime is quite slow to start, the\r\n_FEATool_ GUI may take some minutes to show up after the initial\r\nsplash screen has disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATLAB Toolbox\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIf you have MATLAB, the _FEATool_ toolbox can also be installed directly\r\nfrom the MATLAB APPS and Add-On Toolbar, the MathWorks File Exchange,\r\nor downloaded directly from the link below.\r\n\r\n_FEATool Multiphysics_ has been verified work with 64-bit Windows, Mac\r\nOSX, and Linux operating systems running MATLAB versions 7.9 (R2009b)\r\nand later. Furthermore, a system with 4 GB or more RAM memory is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n### Installation with MATLAB\r\n\r\n- For MATLAB 2012b and later double click on the **[FEATool Multiphysics.mlappinstall](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/blob/master/FEATool%20Multiphysics.mlappinstall?raw=true)**\r\n  file, or use the _Get More Apps_ button in the MATLAB _APPS_\r\n  toolbar. Once the app has been installed, a corresponding icon will\r\n  be available in the toolbar to start _FEATool_. (Note that MATLAB\r\n  may not show or give any indication of the app installation progress\r\n  or completion.)\r\n\r\n- For MATLAB 2009b-2012a, use the _addpath_ command to add the\r\n  extracted _featool_ program directory to the MATLAB search paths, so\r\n  that the program files can be found by the interpreter (for example\r\n  `addpath C:\\featool`). Then simply enter the command `featool` at\r\n  the MATLAB command prompt to start the toolbox GUI and application.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that using spaces in user and installation directory\r\npaths is not recommended as it can potentially cause issues with\r\ninterfaces to external tools, such as geometry engines, grid\r\ngeneration, and external solvers. Moreover, as all functions are\r\ninitially loaded into memory, _FEATool_ may take some time to load and\r\nshow the GUI on initial startup.\r\n\r\n\r\nTutorials and Examples\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPre-defined automated modeling tutorials and examples for various\r\nmulti-physics applications can be selected and run from the **File** >\r\n**Model Examples and Tutorials** menu option. Example m-script files\r\nand simulation models are also available in the _examples folder_ of\r\nthe _FEATool_ program directory. Moreover, more tutorials and articles\r\nare published on the\r\n[FEATool Technical Articles Blog](https://www.featool.com/articles).\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe full\r\n[FEATool Multiphysics Documentation Suite](https://www.featool.com/doc)\r\nis available online and from selecting the corresponding option under\r\nthe _Help_ menu in the _FEATool_ GUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Use\r\n---------\r\n\r\n_FEATool_ and its GUI has been specifically designed to be as easy to\r\nuse as possible, and making learning multiphysics simulation by\r\nexperimentation possible.\r\n\r\nThe standard modeling process is divided into six different steps or modes\r\n\r\n- **Geometry** - Definition of the geometry to be modeled\r\n- **Grid** - Subdivision of the geometry into smaller cells suitable\r\n  for computation\r\n- **Equation** - Specification of material parameters and coefficients\r\n- **Boundary** - Boundary conditions specify how the model interacts\r\n  with the surrounding environment (outside the geometry)\r\n- **Solve** - Solution and simulation of the defined model problem\r\n- **Post** - Visualization and postprocessing of simulation results\r\n\r\nThese modes can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding buttons\r\nin left hand side _Mode_ toolbar. The different modes may have\r\nspecialized and different _Tools_ available in the corresponding\r\ntoolbar. Advanced mode options may also be available in the\r\ncorresponding menus.\r\n\r\nBasic usage and how to set up and model laminar flow past a cylinder\r\nis explained in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZnnXl7ryBMI\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">linked video tutorial</a> (click on the image to view\r\nthe tutorial).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnnXl7ryBMI\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://www.featool.com/images/300-featool-multiphysics-video-tutorial-play.jpg\" alt=\"FEATool Multiphysics Video Tutorial\" style=\"max-width:100%\">\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\nThe _FEATool_ installation can be tested and validated by running the\r\nsimulation model and example test suites by starting _FEATool_ with\r\neither of these commands\r\n\r\n    featool testt    % Run tests for GUI tutorials\r\n    featool teste    % Run tests for m-script examples\r\n    featool test     % Run all test suites\r\n\r\nPlease note that running the test suites may take a significant\r\namount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Solvers (_Optional_)\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n### OpenFOAM\u00ae CFD Solver\r\n\r\nThe optional OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics solver integration\r\nmakes it easy to perform both laminar and turbulent high performance\r\nCFD simulations directly in MATLAB. OpenFOAM flow simulations often\r\nresults in a magnitude or more speedup for instationary simulations\r\ncompared to the built-in flow solvers. Additionally, with the\r\nmulti-simulation solver integration in _FEATool_ it is possible to\r\ncompare and better validate simulation results obtained using both the\r\nbuilt-in, FEniCS, Firedrake, and OpenFOAM solvers.\r\n\r\nThe OpenFOAM solver binaries are not included with the _FEATool_\r\ndistribution and must be installed separately. The FEATool-OpenFOAM\r\nsolver integration has been verified with OpenFOAM version 5. For\r\nWindows systems it is recommended to install and use the pre-compiled\r\nblueCFD-core (2017) binaries from\r\n[blueCAPE](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core). For Linux and MacOS systems\r\nthe distribution from the\r\n[OpenFOAM Foundation](https://openfoam.org/download) is\r\nrecommended. It is necessary that the _simpleFoam_, _pimpleFoam_,\r\n_rhoCentralFoam_, _potentialFoam_, and _collapseEdges_ binaries are\r\ninstalled and properly set up so they can be called from system script\r\nfiles (bash scripts on Linux and MacOS and bat/vbs on Windows).\r\n\r\n\r\n### SU2 CFD Solver\r\n\r\nAlong with OpenFOAM, [SU2](https://su2code.github.io) is one of the\r\nleading and most popular academic research and open-source CFD\r\nsolvers. The SU2 code was initially developed for compressible flows\r\nand aerodynamic shape optimization and but has been extended to handle\r\na wide range of flow problems. FEATool includes the SU2 CFD solver,\r\nand features easy and convenient GUI and CLI interfaces. This allows\r\nSU2 to be used as a solver for both laminar and turbulent\r\nincompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible inviscid Euler flow\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FEniCS and Firedrake PDE Solvers\r\n\r\n[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) and\r\n[Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org/) are flexible and\r\ncomprehensive finite element analysis (FEA) and partial differential\r\nequation (PDE) modeling and simulation toolkit with Python and C++\r\ninterfaces along with many integrated solvers. As both _FEATool_ and\r\nFEniCS discretize equations employing a weak finite element\r\nformulation it is quite straightforward to translate _FEATool_ syntax\r\nand convert it to Python scripts. The FEATool-FEniCS/Firedrake\r\nintegration allows for easy conversion, exporting, solving, and\r\nimporting _FEATool Multiphysics_ models to FEniCS and Firedrake\r\ndirectly from the GUI, as well as the MATLAB CLI.\r\n\r\nFor Ubuntu based Linux and Windows 10 with\r\n[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)\r\nsystems, FEniCS can be installed by opening a terminal shell and\r\nrunning the following commands (which automatically also installs\r\nrequired dependencies such as the Python programming language\r\ninterpreter)\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\r\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics\r\n    sudo apt-get update\r\n    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends fenics\r\n\r\nNote that the _FEATool_ distribution does not include a Python\r\ninterpreter, FEniCS, or Firedrake itself which also must be installed\r\nseparately.  The FEniCS homepage provides instructions\r\n[how to install FEniCS on Linux systems](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)\r\n(note that Docker images are currently not supported by _FEATool_).\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Grid Generators (_Optional_)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_FEATool Multiphysics_ comes with built-in support for the external\r\ngrid and mesh generators [_Gmsh_](http://gmsh.info/), _Gridgen2D_\r\n(included), and\r\n[_Triangle_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), upon\r\nselecting any of these grid generators in the _Grid Settings_ dialog\r\nbox, the corresponding binaries will automatically be downloaded and\r\ninstalled if an internet connection is available. Alternatively, the\r\nmesh generator binaries can downloaded from the\r\n[external grid generators repository](https://github.com/precise-simulation/external-grid-generators)\r\nand/or compiled manually and added to the _FEATool_ installation\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of using either _Gmsh_, _Gridgen2D_, or _Triangle_ compared\r\nto the built-in grid generation functions is both robustness and mesh\r\ngeneration speed. Moreover, external grid generators also supports\r\nbetter and more control with a selection of different mesh generation\r\nalgorithms, and specifying the grid size in different geometry\r\nregions, subdomains, as well as on boundaries, allowing for greater\r\nflexibility and better grids tuned for the specific problems and\r\ngeometries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the external grid generator interfaces, _FEATool_ also\r\nfully supports mesh import and export from the Dolfin/FEniCS (XML),\r\n[GiD](https://www.gidhome.com),\r\n[General Mesh Viewer](http://www.generalmeshviewer.com) (GMV), and\r\n[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org) (VTK/VTP) formats.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n(C) Copyright 2013-2020 by Precise Simulation Ltd.\r\nAll Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFEATool\u2122 and FEATool Multiphysics\u2122 are trademarks of Precise\r\nSimulation Limited.

Features such as an intuitive and easy to learn graphical user\r\ninterface (GUI), a complete library of grid generation, and\r\npostprocessing functions, as well as command line interface (CLI)\r\nprogramming, and interactive and interpreted programming and scripting\r\ncapabilities, makes _FEATool_ suitable for everyone from students\r\nlearning mathematical modeling, to professionals and engineers wishing\r\nto explore new ideas in a simple, fast, and convenient way.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI)\r\n- Fully integrated and built-in pre-processing, CAD tools, automatic\r\n  mesh generation, solvers, post-processing, and visualization\r\n  functionality\r\n- Pre-defined physics modes and equations for heat and mass transfer,\r\n  fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, and\r\n  classical PDE\r\n- Support for custom user-defined equations and PDEs\r\n- Built-in expression parser (enter equations and coefficients _just\r\n  as writing on paper_ without any programming)\r\n- Easy to define fully coupled multiphysics problems\r\n- One-click interfaces for the OpenFOAM\u00ae, SU2, FEniCS, and Firedrake\r\n  external solvers\r\n- Save and export models in binary file format or editable script\r\n  files (every GUI operation is recorded to a corresponding MATLAB\r\n  function call)\r\n- Fully scriptable and programmable with the MATLAB scripting language\r\n  (including support for integration and embedding in custom\r\n  applications and toolboxes)\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe _FEATool Multiphysics_ Toolbox can either be used stand-alone as a\r\nfully integrated simulation GUI, or together with MATLAB enabling\r\ncommand line (CLI) use and scripting. In order to use the _FEATool\r\nMultiphysics_ toolbox, the program files must first be installed on the\r\nintended computer system. Please follow the procedure below for the\r\ncorresponding stand-alone or MATLAB toolbox installation modes. Note\r\nthat it is recommended to first uninstall older versions of _FEATool_\r\nbefore updating to a newer version.\r\n\r\n\r\nStand-alone Toolbox\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFEATool Multiphysics has been compiled to run in stand-alone mode\r\ntogether with the freely available MCR runtime (does not require\r\nMATLAB). Stand-alone mode is supported for 64-bit Windows systems (and\r\nvirtual machines VMs) with 4 GB or more RAM memory.\r\n\r\nTo install, download the installer from link below and run it. The\r\ninstaller will automatically download and install the correct MCR\r\nruntime engine (>=1 GB file size) and then install the FEATool\r\nexecutable. Click on the FEATool icon after the installation has been\r\ncompleted to start the toolbox.<br><br>\r\n\r\n[![FEATool Multiphysics - Stand-Alone Toolbox Download](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/multiphysics/files/1.11.1/FEATool_Multiphysics_webinstaller.exe/download)<br>\r\n\r\nPlease note that as the MCR runtime is quite slow to start, the\r\n_FEATool_ GUI may take some minutes to show up after the initial\r\nsplash screen has disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATLAB Toolbox\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIf you have MATLAB, the _FEATool_ toolbox can also be installed directly\r\nfrom the MATLAB APPS and Add-On Toolbar, the MathWorks File Exchange,\r\nor downloaded directly from the link below.\r\n\r\n_FEATool Multiphysics_ has been verified work with 64-bit Windows, Mac\r\nOSX, and Linux operating systems running MATLAB versions 7.9 (R2009b)\r\nand later. Furthermore, a system with 4 GB or more RAM memory is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n### Installation with MATLAB\r\n\r\n- For MATLAB 2012b and later double click on the **[FEATool Multiphysics.mlappinstall](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/blob/master/FEATool%20Multiphysics.mlappinstall?raw=true)**\r\n  file, or use the _Get More Apps_ button in the MATLAB _APPS_\r\n  toolbar. Once the app has been installed, a corresponding icon will\r\n  be available in the toolbar to start _FEATool_. (Note that MATLAB\r\n  may not show or give any indication of the app installation progress\r\n  or completion.)\r\n\r\n- For MATLAB 2009b-2012a, use the _addpath_ command to add the\r\n  extracted _featool_ program directory to the MATLAB search paths, so\r\n  that the program files can be found by the interpreter (for example\r\n  `addpath C:\\featool`). Then simply enter the command `featool` at\r\n  the MATLAB command prompt to start the toolbox GUI and application.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that using spaces in user and installation directory\r\npaths is not recommended as it can potentially cause issues with\r\ninterfaces to external tools, such as geometry engines, grid\r\ngeneration, and external solvers. Moreover, as all functions are\r\ninitially loaded into memory, _FEATool_ may take some time to load and\r\nshow the GUI on initial startup.\r\n\r\n\r\nTutorials and Examples\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPre-defined automated modeling tutorials and examples for various\r\nmulti-physics applications can be selected and run from the **File** >\r\n**Model Examples and Tutorials** menu option. Example m-script files\r\nand simulation models are also available in the _examples folder_ of\r\nthe _FEATool_ program directory. Moreover, more tutorials and articles\r\nare published on the\r\n[FEATool Technical Articles Blog](https://www.featool.com/articles).\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe full\r\n[FEATool Multiphysics Documentation Suite](https://www.featool.com/doc)\r\nis available online and from selecting the corresponding option under\r\nthe _Help_ menu in the _FEATool_ GUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Use\r\n---------\r\n\r\n_FEATool_ and its GUI has been specifically designed to be as easy to\r\nuse as possible, and making learning multiphysics simulation by\r\nexperimentation possible.\r\n\r\nThe standard modeling process is divided into six different steps or modes\r\n\r\n- **Geometry** - Definition of the geometry to be modeled\r\n- **Grid** - Subdivision of the geometry into smaller cells suitable\r\n  for computation\r\n- **Equation** - Specification of material parameters and coefficients\r\n- **Boundary** - Boundary conditions specify how the model interacts\r\n  with the surrounding environment (outside the geometry)\r\n- **Solve** - Solution and simulation of the defined model problem\r\n- **Post** - Visualization and postprocessing of simulation results\r\n\r\nThese modes can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding buttons\r\nin left hand side _Mode_ toolbar. The different modes may have\r\nspecialized and different _Tools_ available in the corresponding\r\ntoolbar. Advanced mode options may also be available in the\r\ncorresponding menus.\r\n\r\nBasic usage and how to set up and model laminar flow past a cylinder\r\nis explained in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZnnXl7ryBMI\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">linked video tutorial</a> (click on the image to view\r\nthe tutorial).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnnXl7ryBMI\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://www.featool.com/images/300-featool-multiphysics-video-tutorial-play.jpg\" alt=\"FEATool Multiphysics Video Tutorial\" style=\"max-width:100%\">\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\nThe _FEATool_ installation can be tested and validated by running the\r\nsimulation model and example test suites by starting _FEATool_ with\r\neither of these commands\r\n\r\n    featool testt    % Run tests for GUI tutorials\r\n    featool teste    % Run tests for m-script examples\r\n    featool test     % Run all test suites\r\n\r\nPlease note that running the test suites may take a significant\r\namount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Solvers (_Optional_)\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n### OpenFOAM\u00ae CFD Solver\r\n\r\nThe optional OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics solver integration\r\nmakes it easy to perform both laminar and turbulent high performance\r\nCFD simulations directly in MATLAB. OpenFOAM flow simulations often\r\nresults in a magnitude or more speedup for instationary simulations\r\ncompared to the built-in flow solvers. Additionally, with the\r\nmulti-simulation solver integration in _FEATool_ it is possible to\r\ncompare and better validate simulation results obtained using both the\r\nbuilt-in, FEniCS, Firedrake, and OpenFOAM solvers.\r\n\r\nThe OpenFOAM solver binaries are not included with the _FEATool_\r\ndistribution and must be installed separately. The FEATool-OpenFOAM\r\nsolver integration has been verified with OpenFOAM version 5. For\r\nWindows systems it is recommended to install and use the pre-compiled\r\nblueCFD-core (2017) binaries from\r\n[blueCAPE](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core). For Linux and MacOS systems\r\nthe distribution from the\r\n[OpenFOAM Foundation](https://openfoam.org/download) is\r\nrecommended. It is necessary that the _simpleFoam_, _pimpleFoam_,\r\n_rhoCentralFoam_, _potentialFoam_, and _collapseEdges_ binaries are\r\ninstalled and properly set up so they can be called from system script\r\nfiles (bash scripts on Linux and MacOS and bat/vbs on Windows).\r\n\r\n\r\n### SU2 CFD Solver\r\n\r\nAlong with OpenFOAM, [SU2](https://su2code.github.io) is one of the\r\nleading and most popular academic research and open-source CFD\r\nsolvers. The SU2 code was initially developed for compressible flows\r\nand aerodynamic shape optimization and but has been extended to handle\r\na wide range of flow problems. FEATool includes the SU2 CFD solver,\r\nand features easy and convenient GUI and CLI interfaces. This allows\r\nSU2 to be used as a solver for both laminar and turbulent\r\nincompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible inviscid Euler flow\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FEniCS and Firedrake PDE Solvers\r\n\r\n[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org) and\r\n[Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org/) are flexible and\r\ncomprehensive finite element analysis (FEA) and partial differential\r\nequation (PDE) modeling and simulation toolkit with Python and C++\r\ninterfaces along with many integrated solvers. As both _FEATool_ and\r\nFEniCS discretize equations employing a weak finite element\r\nformulation it is quite straightforward to translate _FEATool_ syntax\r\nand convert it to Python scripts. The FEATool-FEniCS/Firedrake\r\nintegration allows for easy conversion, exporting, solving, and\r\nimporting _FEATool Multiphysics_ models to FEniCS and Firedrake\r\ndirectly from the GUI, as well as the MATLAB CLI.\r\n\r\nFor Ubuntu based Linux and Windows 10 with\r\n[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)\r\nsystems, FEniCS can be installed by opening a terminal shell and\r\nrunning the following commands (which automatically also installs\r\nrequired dependencies such as the Python programming language\r\ninterpreter)\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\r\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics\r\n    sudo apt-get update\r\n    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends fenics\r\n\r\nNote that the _FEATool_ distribution does not include a Python\r\ninterpreter, FEniCS, or Firedrake itself which also must be installed\r\nseparately.  The FEniCS homepage provides instructions\r\n[how to install FEniCS on Linux systems](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)\r\n(note that Docker images are currently not supported by _FEATool_).\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Grid Generators (_Optional_)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_FEATool Multiphysics_ comes with built-in support for the external\r\ngrid and mesh generators [_Gmsh_](http://gmsh.info/), _Gridgen2D_\r\n(included), and\r\n[_Triangle_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), upon\r\nselecting any of these grid generators in the _Grid Settings_ dialog\r\nbox, the corresponding binaries will automatically be downloaded and\r\ninstalled if an internet connection is available. Alternatively, the\r\nmesh generator binaries can downloaded from the\r\n[external grid generators repository](https://github.com/precise-simulation/external-grid-generators)\r\nand/or compiled manually and added to the _FEATool_ installation\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of using either _Gmsh_, _Gridgen2D_, or _Triangle_ compared\r\nto the built-in grid generation functions is both robustness and mesh\r\ngeneration speed. Moreover, external grid generators also supports\r\nbetter and more control with a selection of different mesh generation\r\nalgorithms, and specifying the grid size in different geometry\r\nregions, subdomains, as well as on boundaries, allowing for greater\r\nflexibility and better grids tuned for the specific problems and\r\ngeometries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the external grid generator interfaces, _FEATool_ also\r\nfully supports mesh import and export from the Dolfin/FEniCS (XML),\r\n[GiD](https://www.gidhome.com),\r\n[General Mesh Viewer](http://www.generalmeshviewer.com) (GMV), and\r\n[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org) (VTK/VTP) formats.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n(C) Copyright 2013-2020 by Precise Simulation Ltd.\r\nAll Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFEATool\u2122 and FEATool Multiphysics\u2122 are trademarks of Precise\r\nSimulation Limited.

The system supports the following physical phenomena with two-way interaction:\n  - Inter-particle collisions\n  - Rigid bodies with approximated stacking\n  - Friction\n  - Rope and cloth\n  - Fluids\n  - Gases\n\n#### CPU demo scenes\nThe following demo scenes are built in the CPU application, labeled with appropriate key commands to bring them up:\n\n  - *1* - A collapsing sand pile demonstrating frictional effect on angle of repose\n  - *2* - Stiff stacks of rigid bodies\n  - *3* - Stable stacking of rigid bodies in the formation of a wall\n  - *4* - Chained rigid bodies acting as a pendulum\n  - *5* - A fluid caught and held by a rope\n  - *6* - Two fluids settling, demonstrating the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n  - *7* - Solids sinking or floating based on density\n  - *8* - Gas particles interacting with a swinging rope\n  - *9* - A rigid body being stopped by friction\n  - *0* - Fluids trapped like a water balloon\n  - *D* - Gas particles emitted into a closed space\n  - *S* - Gas particles emitted into an open space\n  - *W* - I came in like a wrecking ball!\n  - *N* - Newton's cradle\n  - *.* - Resolution of interlocked rigid bodies\n  - *V* - A volcano erupting and settling\n\nThe following commands may also be useful:\n  - *T* - Toggle real-time or time-step mode\n  - *Space* - move forward by a time step during time-step mode\n  - *R* - reset the simulation\n  - *C* - toggle rendering of individual particles\n\n#### GPU demo scenes\nNote: This version of the program no longer uses the CUDA 7 cuSolver library allowing it to be run on CUDA 5 capable machines.\n\nThe following demo scenes are built in the GPU application, labeled with appropriate key commands to bring them up:\n\n  - *1* - A single rope demonstrating basic distance constraints\n  - *2* - A cloth created with a grid of distance constraints\n  - *3* - Two fluids settling, demonstrating the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n  - *4* - A single stack of solid particles\n  - *5* - Multiple stacks of solid particles\n  - *6* - A grid of solid particles falling into a cloth net\n  - *7* - A giant ball of fluid being fluidy, and demonstrating surface tension\n  - *8* - A

"readme_text": "# Unified Particle Solver\n\n#### An implementation of Macklin et. al's [Unified Particle Physics for Real-Time Applications](http://mmacklin.com/uppfrta_preprint.pdf) for both the CPU and GPU.\n\nThis physics simulation was implemented on both the CPU (leveraging the Qt framework) and GPU (using CUDA) as a final project for Brown University's graduate-level course CSCI2240: Interactive Computer Graphics by Evan Birenbaum '15, Logan Barnes '15, and Geoff Trousdale '15.\n\n#### Overview\nThe simulation supports a variety of states of matter by representing the entire world as a large set of small, individual, and independent particles that are influenced by a set of constraints. The system supports the following physical phenomena with two-way interaction:\n  - Inter-particle collisions\n  - Rigid bodies with approximated stacking\n  - Friction\n  - Rope and cloth\n  - Fluids\n  - Gases\n\n#### CPU demo scenes\nThe following demo scenes are built in the CPU application, labeled with appropriate key commands to bring them up:\n\n  - *1* - A collapsing sand pile demonstrating frictional effect on angle of repose\n  - *2* - Stiff stacks of rigid bodies\n  - *3* - Stable stacking of rigid bodies in the formation of a wall\n  - *4* - Chained rigid bodies acting as a pendulum\n  - *5* - A fluid caught and held by a rope\n  - *6* - Two fluids settling, demonstrating the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n  - *7* - Solids sinking or floating based on density\n  - *8* - Gas particles interacting with a swinging rope\n  - *9* - A rigid body being stopped by friction\n  - *0* - Fluids trapped like a water balloon\n  - *D* - Gas particles emitted into a closed space\n  - *S* - Gas particles emitted into an open space\n  - *W* - I came in like a wrecking ball!\n  - *N* - Newton's cradle\n  - *.* - Resolution of interlocked rigid bodies\n  - *V* - A volcano erupting and settling\n\nThe following commands may also be useful:\n  - *T* - Toggle real-time or time-step mode\n  - *Space* - move forward by a time step during time-step mode\n  - *R* - reset the simulation\n  - *C* - toggle rendering of individual particles\n\n#### GPU demo scenes\nNote: This version of the program no longer uses the CUDA 7 cuSolver library allowing it to be run on CUDA 5 capable machines.\n\nThe following demo scenes are built in the GPU application, labeled with appropriate key commands to bring them up:\n\n  - *1* - A single rope demonstrating basic distance constraints\n  - *2* - A cloth created with a grid of distance constraints\n  - *3* - Two fluids settling, demonstrating the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n  - *4* - A single stack of solid particles\n  - *5* - Multiple stacks of solid particles\n  - *6* - A grid of solid particles falling into a cloth net\n  - *7* - A giant ball of fluid being fluidy, and demonstrating surface tension\n  - *8* - A combo scene of solid particles, cloths, ropes, and an immovable sphere\n  - *9* - Hair...just hair\n  - *0* - Empty scene\n\nMoving around in the scene:\n  - *W* - Move forward\n  - *A* - Move left\n  - *S* - Move backward\n  - *D* - Move right\n  - *Mouse* - Look around\n  - *Left Click* - Shoot particle into scene\n  - *Space* - Add fluid to scene at origin (not guaranteed to maintain stability)\n\n#### Pretty pictures\n\n![](./img/3d1.png)\n![](./img/3d2.png)\n![](./img/3d3.png)\n![](./img/2d1.png)\n![](./img/2d2.png)\n![](./img/2d3.png)\n"}, "vonWolfehaus/von-physics": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "vonWolfehaus/von-physics", "diskUsage": 472, "name": "von-physics", "owner": {"login": "vonWolfehaus"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "JavaScript"}, {"name": "HTML"}]}, "createdAt": "2013-04-23T00:19:25Z", "pushedAt": "2017-02-01T02:59:56Z", "object": {"text": "# \"Arcade\"-style game physics\n\n![screenshot](von-physics.jpg)\n\nAfter implementing far too many collision detection algorithms in my various experiments and games since 2009, I've decided enough is enough and compiled this tiny library of just the raw math behind collision detection and physical response.\n\nIt is meant to provide the minimal (and in most cases sufficient) system necessary for creating high performance real-time applications with dynamic objects interacting with each other.\n\nFeatures:\n* Most efficient techniques for performant detection and response for axis-aligned 2D and 3D boxes and radial colliders\n* Mass and restitution only (sometimes less is more)\n* Continuous collision detection for 2D and 3D radial colliders\n* Signal dispatch on collision that provides collided entity and manifold describing the collision\n* \"World\" class with friction, gravity, and boundaries (infinity works too)\n* Memory-efficient broadphase (2D static grid)\n\nBonus 2D and 3D wandering behavior in the examples.\n\n**Note:** If you use continuous detection and the broadphase grid, it can still miss some collisions because it doesn't check cells that the collider will be in after velocity is applied (it only uses position).\n\n## Full engines with readable code\n\nThese are engines that have fancy things like rotational torque, joints, and so on.

All other platforms (which I think is only desktops now that Android \nis supported, right?) fall back on \n[AwayPhysics](https://github.com/away3d/awayphysics-core-fp11), a pure-AS3 \nimplementation of Bullet, meaning the extension will work on all platforms AIR \nsupports.\n\n---\n\nThe rest of the README:\n\n* Getting Started\n* Building the ANE\n* Comparison to AwayPhysics and Bullet C++ Lib\n\t* Bullet.ane vs. Bullet C++ Lib\n\t* Bullet.ane vs. AwayPhysics\n\t* Nested Meshes\n\t* A Word on Scaling\n* To-do\n* Links\n\n\nGetting Started\n-----\n\nFor convenience, the compiled extension is included in the repository, located \nat `as3/aneBulletTester/ane/Bullet.ane`.  Usage examples can be found in \n`as3/aneBulletTester/src/`.\n\nIf you're already familiar with using ANEs, then go wild.\n\nBut if this is your first ANE experience... To add it to your ActionScript \nMobile project in Flash Builder 4.7 (sorry, I don't know about other IDEs), \nright-click your project and select `Properties`, then click `ActionScript \nBuild Path` on the left side-bar, then `Native Extensions` across the top, \nthen `Add ANE...`\n\nFinally, ensure the extension gets packaged with your debug and release \nbuilds; from the `Properties` window, twist open `ActionScript Build \nPackaging` on the left and select `Apple iOS`, then click `Native Extensions` \nacross the top and ensure that the `Package` checkbox is checked.  Do the same \nwith the `Android` platform.\n\n\nBuilding the ANE\n-----\n\nIf you're the type that's going to build `Bullet.ane` from source, this \nsection should help.  It might not be very complete, so I apologize -- ask on \nGitHub if you need help (github.com/mziwisky/bullet-ane).\n\nFirst off, if you don't have a Mac, I can't help you (yet), because I'm \nbuilding the native iOS library with Xcode.  Also, I rely on Flash Builder for \nthe ActionScript compilation, so I can't help with other IDEs.\n\nOK, you'll need to acquire the following AS3 dependencies:\n\n* [Away3D](https://github.com/away3d/away3d-core-fp11)\n* [AwayPhysics](https://github.com/away3d/awayphysics-core-fp11)\n\n`as3/aneBulletLib` depends on Away3D and `as3/aneBulletDefault` depends on \nboth.  Build those two `aneBullet*` projects.\n\nThen, `cd` to `native/bullet-itself` and run \n`./fetchSourceAndMakeXcodeProjects.bash`.\n\nThen, open `native/ios/BulletANE/BulletANE.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build it \nfor both iOS Device and iPad Simulator.\n\nThen, `cd` back to the top directory and edit the properties in `build.xml` to \naccomodate your system.  Most of it should be alright, but you may need to \nchange `airsdk.dir` and `iossdk.dir`.\n\nFinally, run `ant` in the top directory.\n\nAgain, if anything goes wrong here that you can't figure out on your own, feel \nfree to contact me on GitHub.\n\n\nComparison to AwayPhysics and Bullet C++ Lib\n-----\n\nBullet.ane is certainly inspired by AwayPhysics, but where AwayPhysics methods \ndiffer from their Bullet Lib counterpart, Bullet.ane tends to favor the Bullet \nC++ Lib version over the AwayPhysics version.  This choice was made so that \nthe Bullet Lib documentation, forum posts, etc. are more likely to be accurate \nand helpful in using Bullet.ane.\n\nFor example, the AwayPhysics method `AWPRigidBody::applyForce()` implicitly \ncalls `AWPRigidBody::activate()` after applying the force.  Bullet Lib's \n`btRigidBody::applyForce()` does not implicitly call \n`btRigidBody::activate()`, and nor does Bullet.ane's `RigidBody::applyForce()` \ncall `RigidBody::activate()`.\n\nThere are, however, a few things I preferred about AwayPhysics' API, so I made \nsome deviations from Bullet Lib in a few spots.\n\nFor example, the `Generic6DofConstraint` constructor takes a position vector \nand rotation vector argument for each of the two involved bodies' frames, \nrather than a transform matrix for each of the frames.\n\nI won't make a comprehensive list here of the differences between Bullet.ane \nand AwayPhysics, but I'll try to note all the differences between the \nsemantics of Bullet.ane and Bullet Lib which might lead to headaches if you \ndon't realize them.  I'll also point out a few ways in which Bullet.ane tends \nto differ from AwayPhysics.\n\n#### Bullet.ane vs. Bullet C++ Lib ####\n\n* The Bullet.ane `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` constructor will create a world with \n  the same default configuration that AwayPhysics uses in its \n`::initWithDbvtBroadphase()` method.  So you don't have to do all the typical \nboilerplate code that Bullet Lib requires.  On the other hand, you don't have \ncontrol over the things that the boilerplate code constructs, like the \nCollisionConfiguration and CollisionDispatcher.\n* The Bullet.ane `DiscreteDynamicsWorld::addRigidBody()` method, when called \n  without the optional `group` and `mask` parameters, defaults to `group=1` \nand `mask=-1`.  This is indeed what Bullet Lib does for dynamic (i.e., \nnon-static && non-kinematic) RigidBodies, but not for non-dynamic bodies.  \nBullet.ane does so regardless of the dynamic-ness.\n* The Bullet.ane `BoxShape` takes full-extents as parameters.  The Bullet Lib \n  counterpart takes half-extents.\n\n#### Bullet.ane vs. AwayPhysics ####\n\n* Bullet.ane performs initialization of a `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` within the \n  constructor as opposed to AwayPhysics, which requires a call to \n`AWPDynamicsWorld::initWithDbvtBroadphase()` after construction.\n* AwayPhysics expects any arguments that are rotation vectors to be Euler \n  angles in degrees.  Bullet.ane expects them to be Euler angles in radians.\n* Bullet.ane often expects a `Matrix3D` defining a transform as a method \n  parameter where AwayPhysics would expect a pair of `Vector3D`s defining a \nposition and a rotation.  E.g., in `CompoundShape::addChildShape()`.\n\n#### Nested Meshes ####\n\nHere's what happened.  I was building this app which had an ObjectContainer3D \nhierarchy.  (NOTE: I'm going to talk about some Away3D classes here, like \nObjectContainer3D.  And Mesh.)  Each visible Mesh was a child of one of a set \nof invisible ObjectContainer3Ds, and each of those ObjectContainer3Ds was a \nchild of the Scene3D.  The ObjectContainer3Ds each had a non-identity \ntransform, as did each of the visible Meshes.\n\nI wanted the Meshes to act like physical objects, so I associated each one \nwith a RigidBody, but I did *not* want the ObjectContainer3Ds to be involved \nin the physics.  An Away3D Mesh can have its *local* transform matrix \nmanipulated directly, but not its *scene* transform.  So when I let Bullet \ntake control over the Meshes transforms, it treated them all as direct \nchildren of a single scene, not realizing that their visual representation was \nactually modulated by the transform of their parent ObjectContainer3Ds.  This \ncaused problems such as objects colliding when they were visually very far \napart, e.g., if they each have a local transform of identity, but their \nparents have transforms that are far from each other.\n\nTo reconcile this, the `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` constructor takes a boolean \nparameter, `expectNestedMeshes`, which defaults to `false`.  If it's set to \n`true`, then the scenario I described above is fixed; the ANE uses the inverse \nscene transform of each Mesh's parent to figure out how to set the Mesh's \nlocal transform such that its scene transform correctly matches its Bullet \nworld transform.\n\nMost people won't need to deal with this, because the typical use case will be \nto add Bullet-controlled Meshes directly to the Scene3D, not to parent \ncontainers.\n\n#### A Word on Scaling ####\n\nBy default, the Bullet C++ Lib assumes all units to be SI -- sizes and \npositions are meters, masses are kilograms, time is seconds, etc.  Bullet Lib \nworks best when moving objects are in the size range of 0.05 to 10.0 units \n(meters).  Refer to [the Bullet wiki page on scaling the \nworld](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php?title=Scaling_The_World).\n\nAs a convenience, the DiscreteDynamicsWorld constructor takes a `scaling` \nparameter, and the ANE multiplies all user-specified positions and sizes by \n`(1/scaling)` before it passes those values to the Bullet library.\n\nTherefore, 1 Bullet unit equals `scaling` visual (Away3D) units.\n\nThe default `scaling` is 100.  So by default, the ANE will work best when \nmoving objects are created with a size in the range of 5 to 1000.\n\nNote that ONLY sizes and positions get scaled.  In spite of what the referred \nwiki page suggests, we don't scale velocities, torques, etc.  So a scaling of \n100 can be interpreted as follows.  All positions and sizes (both input to and \noutput from the ANE) are in centimeters, but all other units remain SI.  \nTherefore velocities are m/s (not cm/s), accelerations -- in particular \nacceleration due to gravity -- are m/s^2, forces are Newtons, torques are \nNewton-meters, etc. Note that this agrees with the convention that AwayPhysics \nuses (i.e., only scaling distances and sizes).\n\n\nTo-do\n-----\n\nAn abbreviated list of things on the to-do list for the ANE.  Feel free to \ncontribute!\n\n* Native Desktop lib.  Right now it falls back on AwayPhysics, which is \n  awesome, but performs significantly worse than native code.\n* Add support for other Stage3D-based graphics libraries.\n* Maybe make a big start-to-finish build script if enough people are \n  interested in such a thing.\n* Add collision callbacks.\n* More and more API exposure.\n\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n#### Bullet Physics Library ####\n* [Wiki](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Main_Page)\n* [Forums](http://www.bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3)\n* [Documentation](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php?title=Documentation)\n* [Homepage](http://www.bulletphysics.org/)\n\n#### AIR Native Extensions ####\n* [Nice Adobe \n  reference](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/extensions/air_extensions.pdf)\n\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 28, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "45abcfbeb2fbabd4ad3ca8758dcef73df4884e39 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 627, "author": {"name": "Michael Ziwisky"}, "pushedDate": "2013-10-23T16:56:06Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge branch 'develop'", "message": "Merge branch 'develop'\nMain new feature is Android support."}}, {"node": {"additions": 51, "author": {"name": "Michael Ziwisky"}, "pushedDate": "2013-10-23T16:56:06Z", "messageHeadline": "xcodebuild from command line wasn't working right, so I reverted to b\u2026", "message": "xcodebuild from command line wasn't working right, so I reverted to building the iOS part from the Xcode GUI.

All other platforms (which I think is only desktops now that Android \nis supported, right?) fall back on \n[AwayPhysics](https://github.com/away3d/awayphysics-core-fp11), a pure-AS3 \nimplementation of Bullet, meaning the extension will work on all platforms AIR \nsupports.\n\n---\n\nThe rest of the README:\n\n* Getting Started\n* Building the ANE\n* Comparison to AwayPhysics and Bullet C++ Lib\n\t* Bullet.ane vs. Bullet C++ Lib\n\t* Bullet.ane vs. AwayPhysics\n\t* Nested Meshes\n\t* A Word on Scaling\n* To-do\n* Links\n\n\nGetting Started\n-----\n\nFor convenience, the compiled extension is included in the repository, located \nat `as3/aneBulletTester/ane/Bullet.ane`.  Usage examples can be found in \n`as3/aneBulletTester/src/`.\n\nIf you're already familiar with using ANEs, then go wild.\n\nBut if this is your first ANE experience... To add it to your ActionScript \nMobile project in Flash Builder 4.7 (sorry, I don't know about other IDEs), \nright-click your project and select `Properties`, then click `ActionScript \nBuild Path` on the left side-bar, then `Native Extensions` across the top, \nthen `Add ANE...`\n\nFinally, ensure the extension gets packaged with your debug and release \nbuilds; from the `Properties` window, twist open `ActionScript Build \nPackaging` on the left and select `Apple iOS`, then click `Native Extensions` \nacross the top and ensure that the `Package` checkbox is checked.  Do the same \nwith the `Android` platform.\n\n\nBuilding the ANE\n-----\n\nIf you're the type that's going to build `Bullet.ane` from source, this \nsection should help.  It might not be very complete, so I apologize -- ask on \nGitHub if you need help (github.com/mziwisky/bullet-ane).\n\nFirst off, if you don't have a Mac, I can't help you (yet), because I'm \nbuilding the native iOS library with Xcode.  Also, I rely on Flash Builder for \nthe ActionScript compilation, so I can't help with other IDEs.\n\nOK, you'll need to acquire the following AS3 dependencies:\n\n* [Away3D](https://github.com/away3d/away3d-core-fp11)\n* [AwayPhysics](https://github.com/away3d/awayphysics-core-fp11)\n\n`as3/aneBulletLib` depends on Away3D and `as3/aneBulletDefault` depends on \nboth.  Build those two `aneBullet*` projects.\n\nThen, `cd` to `native/bullet-itself` and run \n`./fetchSourceAndMakeXcodeProjects.bash`.\n\nThen, open `native/ios/BulletANE/BulletANE.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build it \nfor both iOS Device and iPad Simulator.\n\nThen, `cd` back to the top directory and edit the properties in `build.xml` to \naccomodate your system.  Most of it should be alright, but you may need to \nchange `airsdk.dir` and `iossdk.dir`.\n\nFinally, run `ant` in the top directory.\n\nAgain, if anything goes wrong here that you can't figure out on your own, feel \nfree to contact me on GitHub.\n\n\nComparison to AwayPhysics and Bullet C++ Lib\n-----\n\nBullet.ane is certainly inspired by AwayPhysics, but where AwayPhysics methods \ndiffer from their Bullet Lib counterpart, Bullet.ane tends to favor the Bullet \nC++ Lib version over the AwayPhysics version.  This choice was made so that \nthe Bullet Lib documentation, forum posts, etc. are more likely to be accurate \nand helpful in using Bullet.ane.\n\nFor example, the AwayPhysics method `AWPRigidBody::applyForce()` implicitly \ncalls `AWPRigidBody::activate()` after applying the force.  Bullet Lib's \n`btRigidBody::applyForce()` does not implicitly call \n`btRigidBody::activate()`, and nor does Bullet.ane's `RigidBody::applyForce()` \ncall `RigidBody::activate()`.\n\nThere are, however, a few things I preferred about AwayPhysics' API, so I made \nsome deviations from Bullet Lib in a few spots.\n\nFor example, the `Generic6DofConstraint` constructor takes a position vector \nand rotation vector argument for each of the two involved bodies' frames, \nrather than a transform matrix for each of the frames.\n\nI won't make a comprehensive list here of the differences between Bullet.ane \nand AwayPhysics, but I'll try to note all the differences between the \nsemantics of Bullet.ane and Bullet Lib which might lead to headaches if you \ndon't realize them.  I'll also point out a few ways in which Bullet.ane tends \nto differ from AwayPhysics.\n\n#### Bullet.ane vs. Bullet C++ Lib ####\n\n* The Bullet.ane `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` constructor will create a world with \n  the same default configuration that AwayPhysics uses in its \n`::initWithDbvtBroadphase()` method.  So you don't have to do all the typical \nboilerplate code that Bullet Lib requires.  On the other hand, you don't have \ncontrol over the things that the boilerplate code constructs, like the \nCollisionConfiguration and CollisionDispatcher.\n* The Bullet.ane `DiscreteDynamicsWorld::addRigidBody()` method, when called \n  without the optional `group` and `mask` parameters, defaults to `group=1` \nand `mask=-1`.  This is indeed what Bullet Lib does for dynamic (i.e., \nnon-static && non-kinematic) RigidBodies, but not for non-dynamic bodies.  \nBullet.ane does so regardless of the dynamic-ness.\n* The Bullet.ane `BoxShape` takes full-extents as parameters.  The Bullet Lib \n  counterpart takes half-extents.\n\n#### Bullet.ane vs. AwayPhysics ####\n\n* Bullet.ane performs initialization of a `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` within the \n  constructor as opposed to AwayPhysics, which requires a call to \n`AWPDynamicsWorld::initWithDbvtBroadphase()` after construction.\n* AwayPhysics expects any arguments that are rotation vectors to be Euler \n  angles in degrees.  Bullet.ane expects them to be Euler angles in radians.\n* Bullet.ane often expects a `Matrix3D` defining a transform as a method \n  parameter where AwayPhysics would expect a pair of `Vector3D`s defining a \nposition and a rotation.  E.g., in `CompoundShape::addChildShape()`.\n\n#### Nested Meshes ####\n\nHere's what happened.  I was building this app which had an ObjectContainer3D \nhierarchy.  (NOTE: I'm going to talk about some Away3D classes here, like \nObjectContainer3D.  And Mesh.)  Each visible Mesh was a child of one of a set \nof invisible ObjectContainer3Ds, and each of those ObjectContainer3Ds was a \nchild of the Scene3D.  The ObjectContainer3Ds each had a non-identity \ntransform, as did each of the visible Meshes.\n\nI wanted the Meshes to act like physical objects, so I associated each one \nwith a RigidBody, but I did *not* want the ObjectContainer3Ds to be involved \nin the physics.  An Away3D Mesh can have its *local* transform matrix \nmanipulated directly, but not its *scene* transform.  So when I let Bullet \ntake control over the Meshes transforms, it treated them all as direct \nchildren of a single scene, not realizing that their visual representation was \nactually modulated by the transform of their parent ObjectContainer3Ds.  This \ncaused problems such as objects colliding when they were visually very far \napart, e.g., if they each have a local transform of identity, but their \nparents have transforms that are far from each other.\n\nTo reconcile this, the `DiscreteDynamicsWorld` constructor takes a boolean \nparameter, `expectNestedMeshes`, which defaults to `false`.  If it's set to \n`true`, then the scenario I described above is fixed; the ANE uses the inverse \nscene transform of each Mesh's parent to figure out how to set the Mesh's \nlocal transform such that its scene transform correctly matches its Bullet \nworld transform.\n\nMost people won't need to deal with this, because the typical use case will be \nto add Bullet-controlled Meshes directly to the Scene3D, not to parent \ncontainers.\n\n#### A Word on Scaling ####\n\nBy default, the Bullet C++ Lib assumes all units to be SI -- sizes and \npositions are meters, masses are kilograms, time is seconds, etc.  Bullet Lib \nworks best when moving objects are in the size range of 0.05 to 10.0 units \n(meters).  Refer to [the Bullet wiki page on scaling the \nworld](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php?title=Scaling_The_World).\n\nAs a convenience, the DiscreteDynamicsWorld constructor takes a `scaling` \nparameter, and the ANE multiplies all user-specified positions and sizes by \n`(1/scaling)` before it passes those values to the Bullet library.\n\nTherefore, 1 Bullet unit equals `scaling` visual (Away3D) units.\n\nThe default `scaling` is 100.  So by default, the ANE will work best when \nmoving objects are created with a size in the range of 5 to 1000.\n\nNote that ONLY sizes and positions get scaled.  In spite of what the referred \nwiki page suggests, we don't scale velocities, torques, etc.  So a scaling of \n100 can be interpreted as follows.  All positions and sizes (both input to and \noutput from the ANE) are in centimeters, but all other units remain SI.  \nTherefore velocities are m/s (not cm/s), accelerations -- in particular \nacceleration due to gravity -- are m/s^2, forces are Newtons, torques are \nNewton-meters, etc. Note that this agrees with the convention that AwayPhysics \nuses (i.e., only scaling distances and sizes).\n\n\nTo-do\n-----\n\nAn abbreviated list of things on the to-do list for the ANE.  Feel free to \ncontribute!\n\n* Native Desktop lib.  Right now it falls back on AwayPhysics, which is \n  awesome, but performs significantly worse than native code.\n* Add support for other Stage3D-based graphics libraries.\n* Maybe make a big start-to-finish build script if enough people are \n  interested in such a thing.\n* Add collision callbacks.\n* More and more API exposure.\n\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n#### Bullet Physics Library ####\n* [Wiki](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Main_Page)\n* [Forums](http://www.bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3)\n* [Documentation](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php?title=Documentation)\n* [Homepage](http://www.bulletphysics.org/)\n\n#### AIR Native Extensions ####\n* [Nice Adobe \n  reference](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/extensions/air_extensions.pdf)\n\n"}, "fkrzikalla/drp-benchmarks": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "fkrzikalla/drp-benchmarks", "diskUsage": 4405217, "name": "drp-benchmarks", "owner": {"login": "fkrzikalla"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "MATLAB"}]}, "createdAt": "2012-09-17T23:27:47Z", "pushedAt": "2012-09-18T21:03:08Z", "object": {"text": "drp-benchmarks\n==============\n\nSupplements to \"Digital Rock Physics Benchmarks\"\n\nAUTHORS\n\nHeiko Andr\u00e4\nJack Dvorkin\nMatthias Kabel\nYoungseuk Keehm\nMinhui Lee\nJunehee Han\nFabian Krzikalla (krz@stanford.edu)\nClaudio Madonna\nMike Marsh\nNicolas Combaret\nTapan Mukerji\nSarah Ricker\nErik Saenger\nRatnanabha Sain\nNishank Saxena\nAndreas Wiegmann\nErik Glatt\nXin Zhan\n\nCONTENT\n\nThe natural samples are provided in raw grayscale tif format (Berea sandstone and Grosmont carbonate), and as segmented images.

Tutorials are available as PDFs, HTML webpages, and interactive Jupyter notebooks. The folder structure is `tutorials/<category>/<tutorial name>/`. Each tutorial folder is a Julia project, which can be `] activate`d and `] instantiate`d. For more information, please consult the [JuliaPhysics webpage](http://juliaphysics.github.io), which also lists a bunch of external tutorials.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* General\n  * [Speeding up Quantum Mechanics - Matrix Types](https://juliaphysics.github.io/PhysicsTutorials.jl/tutorials/general/matrix_types/matrix_types.html)\n  * [Quantum Ising Phase Transition](https://juliaphysics.github.io/PhysicsTutorials.jl/tutorials/general/quantum_ising/quantum_ising.html)\n  \n* Machine Learning\n  * [Machine Learning the Ising Transition](https://juliaphysics.github.io/PhysicsTutorials.jl/tutorials/machine_learning/ml_ising/ml_ising.html)\n\n## Interactive Jupyter Notebooks\n\nTo run the tutorials interactively in Jupyter notebooks, install the package and IJulia via\n\n```\n] add http://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PhysicsTutorials IJulia\n```\n\nand start/open the notebook server like\n\n```julia\nusing PhysicsTutorials, IJulia\nPhysicsTutorials.open_notebooks()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSupported source files for tutorials are Jupyter notebooks, Weave.jl files, or Literate.jl files.\nTo contribute a tutorial, clone the repository and put the source file into `tutorials/<category>/<tutorial_name>/` and name it `<tutorial_name>.ipynb` (extension `.jmd`/`.jl` for Weave/Literate sources). To trigger the generation process of all output formats, run the following code from within the repository root folder:\n\n0. Make sure you have `Fire` installed, if not, install it with `] add Fire`,\n1. Create the source file `tutorials/<category>/<tutorial_name>/<tutorial_name>.<extension>`, where the extension should be either `.ipynb`, `.jl`, or `.jmd`.\n2.

is a lab write-up I put together for Portland State University's Physics 315 class.  Its based off a prior student, Marshal Colville's, work.  It adds more instruction and background.  \n\nOriginally written in LaTeX, the main micro-controller lab was converted to Word, so now it is missing edits from the version used in class.  I plan to eventually get those changes in.\n\nA quick PID .ino program was put together to address some of the usability issues found in Marshal's original write up.

This module initializes the physics world and provides us with functions to create the handfull of predefined body forms needed.\n\nThe ship sprite is the only moving sprite and therefor the only type of object  that must update its position according to the box2d simulation. It does so by reading the appropriate values from the box2d body it has attached:\n\n    // in Ship.prototype.update\n    var t = this.b2body.m_xf;\n    this.rect.left = t.position.x;\n    this.rect.top = t.position.y;\n\nCompared to the other sprites, ships interact a lot with the physics stuff. For example, I forcefully stop a Ship once it moves really slowly (to avoid boring the player).\n\nAnother box2d related class to highlight is the ContactListener. The listener instance gets informed about all collision in the box2d world. The collision results only specify the box2d bodies involved but each of those bodies has a userData object attached. And via that userData the ContactListener can resolve which sprite or other game object the physics body belongs to and what the collision means for the game (e.g., point scored, ship killed).\n\nTouch interfaces & low CPU environment\n---------------------------------------\n\nPlanetary runs on the iPad at about 7 frames per second. I took extra care *not* to deplete the iPad's battery: fps.js keeps an average of the frames rendered per second. Heavy optimizations kick in if the average drops below a certain threshold.\n\nFor touch interfaces I am simply re-dispatching touch events as mouse events. The mouse events then get picked up, as usual, by the GameJs event system. This is good enough for simple drag & drop interactions. And that way I didn't even have to modify any of the game's event handlers. The small touch.js module creates the necessary Dom handlers that do the re-dispatching.\n\nThe rest of the modules are the usual suspects: actors.js holds the gamejs.sprite.Sprite subclasses - anything visible on the screen - and main.js is mostly model logic and event handling.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "726fd50e497f84308cb7ea820d271a3c6f289a0b 3"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-12-15T17:29:01Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-02-15T19:28:49Z", "messageHeadline": "README clarify gamejs app", "message": "README clarify gamejs app"}}, {"node": {"additions": 6, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-01-31T08:20:47Z", "messageHeadline": "readme fixes", "message": "readme fixes"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1389, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "initial commit", "message": "initial commit"}}]}}}}, "name": "planetary-gamejs", "owner": "oberhamsi", "creation_date": "2011-01-31T08:17:21Z", "last_push_date": "2011-12-15T17:29:01Z", "commit_page_data": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "726fd50e497f84308cb7ea820d271a3c6f289a0b 3"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-12-15T17:29:01Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-02-15T19:28:49Z", "messageHeadline": "README clarify gamejs app", "message": "README clarify gamejs app"}}, {"node": {"additions": 6, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-01-31T08:20:47Z", "messageHeadline": "readme fixes", "message": "readme fixes"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1389, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "initial commit", "message": "initial commit"}}]}, "has_next_page": false, "commits": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-12-15T17:29:01Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-02-15T19:28:49Z", "messageHeadline": "README clarify gamejs app", "message": "README clarify gamejs app"}}, {"node": {"additions": 6, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": "2011-01-31T08:20:47Z", "messageHeadline": "readme fixes", "message": "readme fixes"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1389, "author": {"name": "Simon Oberhammer"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "initial commit", "message": "initial commit"}}], "total_commits": 4, "languages": ["JavaScript"], "readme_text": "Planetary\n===============================\n\nA Gamejs.org application built for the Global Game Jam 2011.\n\n  * Play: <http://gamejs.org/apps/planetary>\n  * Code: <https://github.com/oberhamsi/planetary-gamejs/>\n\nBox2d\n-------\n\nThe game interacts with the box2d code via my custom, small box2d.js module.

**Axis-Aligned-Bounding-Boxes** (*aka AABB*).\n\nThis library isn't a fully featured physics engine : don't expect a realistic physics simulation but it could be enough for basic game physics (platformer games, top-down games, shoot-em-ups). Though, Humper has spatial hashing for better performances and all the necessary moving and collision test tools needed for building a 2D game.\n\nThe library doesn't rely on any particular framework, its pure C# with all needed types included.

(Planned or Impractical Features)\n* Handle collisions with the level\n    * You can get around this by adding kinematic objects where the level geometry is. (Models do not have to be visible to be included in the simulation!)\n* Use .mdl or collision meshes\n    * Only the bounding boxes are used for simulation. Support for capsules and spheres will be added at a later date.\n    * Loading from .mdl probably isn't going to happen. Loading from .smd or other formats might, but not for a while.\n* Springs, explosions, etc.\n    * These will (hopefully) be in a later release\n\n### How to install\n* Grab this repository with git, or download the .zip (\"Download ZIP\" button in the right margin)\n* Extract and copy the \"platform\" and \"sdktools\" folders to [steamapps]/common/SourceFilmmaker/game. Choose to merge folders.\n\n### How to use\n* Start sfm, and set up your scene. Attach a rig_physics to any objects you want included in the simulation.\n* The \"shape\" control works as follows: if value < 0.5 (slider on the left half), \"box\" is selected; if value > 0.5 (slider on the right half), \"sphere\" is selected.\n* The \"kinematic\" control is \"dynamic\" for values < 0.5; \"kinematic\" for values > 0.5.\n* The \"center of mass\" control currently does not function properly, and the \"force\" control will need some tweaking to be more useful (note that you can also rotate the \"force\" control to apply torque to an object).\n* The \"damping\" controls determine how quickly objects lose momentum over time. If objects are shaking uncontrollably, try increasing the damping; if they are moving too slowly, try decreasing. The defaults are generally fine for rigidbodies; you may want to increase for ragdolls, and cloth physics will require tweaking on an individual basis.\n* Select a period of time to simulate over in the motion editor (ie, with the floating modification layer). The simulation will not run if the time selection is infinite in either direction.\n* Once the scene is set up, go to \"Scripts\" in the main menu bar and select \"Run sfmphys Simulation\"\n\n### Some notes on ragdolls\n* Animation with ragdolls is difficult since you have to use the physics handles. I'll add an option to use the model's normal bones for fully-kinematic objects in the future.\n* Ropes use the positions of bones at the start of the time selection to determine how joints should line up. So for the best results, leave the model in its default position (ie, t-pose for ragdolls, straight line for ropes) and then animate any kinematic bones into position before the scene starts and give the sim a second to stabilize.\n\n### Some notes on cloth\n* You *need* a .physics.txt file to create cloth bodies. An example cloth model is included in the /usermod/models/narry/ folder. Another file, windrunner_cape.physics.txt is also included as an example of rigging a cloth model from DOTA 2. The \"width\" and \"height\" parameters are self-explanatory; the \"boneformat\" parameter is described in more detail at http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples. The script iterates each variable {0}, {1}, ..., {n} over the ranges provided in \"formatranges\" and creates a bone for each. The order of iteration is to increment {0} first, then {1}, etc. The cloth is assumed to always be a 2D plane with dimensions defined by the \"width\" and \"height\" parameters regardless of how many variables are in the \"boneformat\" string.\n* To make kinematic cloth, open the rigged animation set in the Element Viewer and navigate to \"Root Control Group -> children -> SoftBodies -> children -> (cloth name)\" and open the node list. From there you can edit the masses of nodes (use 1 for dynamic and 0 for kinematic). If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to poke around the other parts of the physics rigs in the element viewer. There are some parameters there that I either didn't or couldn't turn into sliders for the rig.\n\n### Videos\nDay 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDMB95El9GA  \nDay 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99sJrXWOxo  \nDay 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQ50YWORcA  \nDay 5 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyzgnJhkdeQ  \nDay 5.5 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyKmftF3ZX0  \nDay whatever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgTciTTUs8  \nDay whatever + 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELrKtixYog  \nDay cloth: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2TTc0GKh4  \nDay cloth2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy2ICpS0znw  \nCloth Parameters Reference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxK6saPpbW8  \n\nThis project uses the bullet physics library.

Fixed some errors in the sim script\n\nUpdate 13 August 2013\n\n* Updated to Python 2.7.5 (for the July 31 SFM update)\n* Updated all guis to use PySide qt bindings\n* Moved phys_simulate to the global scripts menu; it is no longer a \"rig\" script\n* Started work on some fancy GUI things -- not included in this update, just thought I'd mention.\n\nUpdate 2 May 2013\n\n* Updated to Python 2.7 (for the May 1 SFM update)\n* Added a \"mass\" attribute for rigid and soft bodies, accessible through the *element viewer*. The default of 1 should serve well enough for most props, but for exceptionally large or small props (or if you want to simulate, say, something like a seesaw) it's now there for you to adjust. See also: large cloth needs extra mass to scale well, so if you're working with large cloth and things pass through or break entirely, consider adjusting the mass.\n\nUpdate 23 April 2013\n\n* If you are updating to this version from a previous version, try to remove the files from the previous version to avoid any conflicts; there aren't be any specific problems that I am aware of, but just to be sure.\n* bullet_server is no longer needed. Just run the scripts and go!\n* better automatic rigging for ragdolls, and more configurable joint constraints\n* soft-body physics, with an emphasis on cloth (and the possibility for some other limited applications)\n\nOlder versions\n\n* Nyeh, I didn't have a changelog. And it's not all that interesting. Just pretend I started with the April 23 release if it makes any difference :P.\n\n#SFM Physics Scripts\n### What does this do?\n* Incorporates physics simulation into SFM via python scripts\n* Handles collision detection and response\n* Can create physics-controlled, static, and kinematic bodies\n* Can create ragdolls and ropes, assuming the source model is set up with proper hitboxes\n* Can simulate cloth physics, given a properly set-up model\n* You can adjust the density, bounciness, and friction of objects\n* You can animate external forces on objects\n* It *might* crash SFM. If you're concerned, *backup your important files*, just in case.\n\n### What does this not do? (Planned or Impractical Features)\n* Handle collisions with the level\n    * You can get around this by adding kinematic objects where the level geometry is. (Models do not have to be visible to be included in the simulation!)\n* Use .mdl or collision meshes\n    * Only the bounding boxes are used for simulation. Support for capsules and spheres will be added at a later date.\n    * Loading from .mdl probably isn't going to happen. Loading from .smd or other formats might, but not for a while.\n* Springs, explosions, etc.\n    * These will (hopefully) be in a later release\n\n### How to install\n* Grab this repository with git, or download the .zip (\"Download ZIP\" button in the right margin)\n* Extract and copy the \"platform\" and \"sdktools\" folders to [steamapps]/common/SourceFilmmaker/game. Choose to merge folders.\n\n### How to use\n* Start sfm, and set up your scene. Attach a rig_physics to any objects you want included in the simulation.\n* The \"shape\" control works as follows: if value < 0.5 (slider on the left half), \"box\" is selected; if value > 0.5 (slider on the right half), \"sphere\" is selected.\n* The \"kinematic\" control is \"dynamic\" for values < 0.5; \"kinematic\" for values > 0.5.\n* The \"center of mass\" control currently does not function properly, and the \"force\" control will need some tweaking to be more useful (note that you can also rotate the \"force\" control to apply torque to an object).\n* The \"damping\" controls determine how quickly objects lose momentum over time. If objects are shaking uncontrollably, try increasing the damping; if they are moving too slowly, try decreasing. The defaults are generally fine for rigidbodies; you may want to increase for ragdolls, and cloth physics will require tweaking on an individual basis.\n* Select a period of time to simulate over in the motion editor (ie, with the floating modification layer). The simulation will not run if the time selection is infinite in either direction.\n* Once the scene is set up, go to \"Scripts\" in the main menu bar and select \"Run sfmphys Simulation\"\n\n### Some notes on ragdolls\n* Animation with ragdolls is difficult since you have to use the physics handles. I'll add an option to use the model's normal bones for fully-kinematic objects in the future.\n* Ropes use the positions of bones at the start of the time selection to determine how joints should line up. So for the best results, leave the model in its default position (ie, t-pose for ragdolls, straight line for ropes) and then animate any kinematic bones into position before the scene starts and give the sim a second to stabilize.\n\n### Some notes on cloth\n* You *need* a .physics.txt file to create cloth bodies. An example cloth model is included in the /usermod/models/narry/ folder. Another file, windrunner_cape.physics.txt is also included as an example of rigging a cloth model from DOTA 2. The \"width\" and \"height\" parameters are self-explanatory; the \"boneformat\" parameter is described in more detail at http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples. The script iterates each variable {0}, {1}, ..., {n} over the ranges provided in \"formatranges\" and creates a bone for each. The order of iteration is to increment {0} first, then {1}, etc. The cloth is assumed to always be a 2D plane with dimensions defined by the \"width\" and \"height\" parameters regardless of how many variables are in the \"boneformat\" string.\n* To make kinematic cloth, open the rigged animation set in the Element Viewer and navigate to \"Root Control Group -> children -> SoftBodies -> children -> (cloth name)\" and open the node list. From there you can edit the masses of nodes (use 1 for dynamic and 0 for kinematic). If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to poke around the other parts of the physics rigs in the element viewer. There are some parameters there that I either didn't or couldn't turn into sliders for the rig.\n\n### Videos\nDay 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDMB95El9GA  \nDay 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99sJrXWOxo  \nDay 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQ50YWORcA  \nDay 5 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyzgnJhkdeQ  \nDay 5.5 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyKmftF3ZX0  \nDay whatever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgTciTTUs8  \nDay whatever + 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELrKtixYog  \nDay cloth: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2TTc0GKh4  \nDay cloth2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy2ICpS0znw  \nCloth Parameters Reference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxK6saPpbW8  \n\nThis project uses the bullet physics library.

I'd recommend using the included SVG files as a rough idea of what will work and what won't. \n \n==========\n\n### Examples\n\nThis library was abstracted out of my current portfolio:\n\n[http://mike-tucker.com/13](http://mike-tucker.com/13/)\n\n### Plugins\n\nThere are various plugins included, and here are some examples:\n\n* [MousePull](http://mike-tucker.com/13/hello) - Attractor based on mouse or touch inputs\n* [Gravity](http://mike-tucker.com/13/contact) - Constant force applied to all verlet points\n* [Wind](http://mike-tucker.com/13/grid) - Applies forces to verlet points using perlin noise\n* [NoiseWarp](http://mike-tucker.com/13/media_space) - Offsets verlet points with a perlin noise field\n* StatWrapper - Because every JS library needs some [Mr Doob](github.com/mrdoob/) stats.\n\n==========\n\n## Getting Started: For Designers\n\nThis isn't the easiest thing to get working, but later versions might fix that. For the time being, I'd recommend using an existing example page as a template. \n\nA common workflow without code would be:\n\n1. Open one of the example `.svg` files in Illustrator or whatever vector program.\n2. Open the corresponding HTML page in a browser.\n2. Make changes to the SVG file, hit save.\n3. Refresh the browser to see the changes.\n\n==========\n\n## Getting Started: For Developers\n\nIf you're new to CoffeeScript, I'd suggest reading up here: [coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org/)\n\n#### 1) Install the [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) packages\n\n`\tnpm install\n`\n\n#### 2) Start watching for coffeescript updates\n\nThis library uses [coffee-toaster](https://github.com/serpentem/coffee-toaster) for compiling all of the `.coffee` files together. \n\nI'm sure there are other ones out there, so if any others work for you, let me know.\n\n\n`\n\ttoaster -w\n`\n\n#### 3) Save and Iterate\n\nAny changes to your `.coffee` files will automatically compile into `js/main.js`. \n\nThen just refresh your browser, or try using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).\n\n\n#### 4) \"But I hate coffeescript\"\n\nCalm down, you don't need to use it. Just include the main js file, and extend the classes however you want.\n\nHowever, you'll probably want to read the `.coffee` source files to get an idea of what is going on inside.\n\n\n#### 5) Loading external SVG files\n\nCopy and pasting SVG data into the HTML file gets old fast.\n\nOpen the `external-file.html` example. \n\nThis requires a webserver because of local file policies with javascript. If you're just starting out, I recommend [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) (Mac) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows)\n\n\n#### 6) Extras\n\nYou'll notice in the examples files, there are little tidbits that are done outside of the classes. This is where plugins can go, and other changes to the scene.\n\n\n==========\n\n## Rendering\n\n\nIf you're browsing through the source, you may notice fragments of a [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) renderer. I explored this briefly with the hope that Canvas rendering on Mobile would be faster than SVG. The experiment failed, maybe Paper.js was too heavy? Or the code sucked, not sure.\n\nPerhaps another canvas library would be a better match. If you have recommendations, please let me know!\n\n==========\n\n\n## Thank the tech gods\n\nHere are some various techs that this library takes advantage of (if you're not already familiar.)\n\n\n### [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)\n\nAn open-source vector format supported by most browsers. Easy for designers to lay out thing. Looks great on high-density screens.\n\nAt the moment, all renderering is done by manipulating SVG elements on the stage.\n\n### [Verlet Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)\n\nA simple, and optimized way of implementing soft-body physics. It simply maintains a distance between two points.\n\n### [Perlin Noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise)\n\nThis is the secret sauce for procedural animation. If you're not familiar with it, you should be. It's use for the wind animation, among other things.\n\n#### [Quadtree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)\n\nThis is used to determine which points are overlapping, and then creates the appropriate verlet connections.\n\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "ed08ef375cb99b755ba91467b84376d0599158de 4"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 330, "author": {"name": "Mike Tucker"}, "pushedDate": "2013-11-05T12:36:57Z", "messageHeadline": "mouse and gravity improvements for mobile", "message": "mouse and gravity improvements for mobile"}}, {"node": {"additions": 11, "author": {"name": "Mike Tucker"}, "pushedDate": "2013-11-04T21:38:51Z", "messageHeadline": "Removed various console logs", "message": "Removed various console logs"}}, {"node": {"additions": 449, "author": {"name": "Mike Tucker"}, "pushedDate": "2013-11-04T16:28:50Z", "messageHeadline": "All plugins now extend BasePlugin.

animation of the circles which are present in Apple Music iOS app. Unfortunately, Apple Music Android\napp doesn't come with such animations. So i tried my hands and made it for Android. The initial version of the animation\ncovers the most important functionalities of that.\n\n## Demo\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzkK9rtabZw\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/lzkK9rtabZw/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n## GIF demo\nThe above video link is a high resolution demo for the animation. In case you dont want to redirect to that demo, here is a\nGIF demo that will play in here, but it has a low frame rate. I didn't find any tool to convert a high quality video into\na GIF with a high frame rate.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ![](animation_demo.gif)\n\n## How is this made?\nFew libraies that helped me enormously in making this animation is\n1. [Box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D)  by Erin Catto. Although this library is very huge and it covers all the\ndifferent aspects of simulating the real world physics in programming world, i was able to make this animation by using only\na handful of its APIs. Box2d is the most popular physics engine in the world. It contains APIs for almost everything that we\nwant to simulate like Collision, contacts between bodies, radial gravity. Box2d forms the basis of many game engines like\nCocos2d, which also involves the rendering engine in itself.\n\n2. [JBox2D Demo](https://github.com/HaydnTrigg/JBox2D-Demo) by Hadyn Trigg. JBox2d is actually the Java code of Box2d plus\nsome additional APIs. I didn't know how to render the objects on screen in Android when i started with Box2d. The rendering\nengine in the animation is based out on this demo app.\n\n3. [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) This is the Java OpenGL Mathematics library is used to calculate matrices for OpenGL that OpenGL shaders can use to draw geometry to the screen. Its also bundled in the JBox2d demo.\n\n\nI will be publishing a blog regarding how this animaton is made and what all conecpts of physics goes into this. Please watch\nout my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@rahulraja) and my [personal blog](http://rahulrj.github.io/).\n\n\n## Next Release\n1. Click to enlarge the circles\n2. Reset Animation\n3. Swirl animation of the circles while they move.\n4. And of course a blog regarding this.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 45, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "aef46088511692e5c1d3144e3a657b486f605811 24"},

in Apple Music iOS app. Unfortunately, Apple Music Android\napp doesn't come with such animations. So i tried my hands and made it for Android. The initial version of the animation\ncovers the most important functionalities of that.\n\n## Demo\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzkK9rtabZw\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/lzkK9rtabZw/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n## GIF demo\nThe above video link is a high resolution demo for the animation. In case you dont want to redirect to that demo, here is a\nGIF demo that will play in here, but it has a low frame rate. I didn't find any tool to convert a high quality video into\na GIF with a high frame rate.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ![](animation_demo.gif)\n\n## How is this made?\nFew libraies that helped me enormously in making this animation is\n1. [Box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D)  by Erin Catto. Although this library is very huge and it covers all the\ndifferent aspects of simulating the real world physics in programming world, i was able to make this animation by using only\na handful of its APIs. Box2d is the most popular physics engine in the world. It contains APIs for almost everything that we\nwant to simulate like Collision, contacts between bodies, radial gravity. Box2d forms the basis of many game engines like\nCocos2d, which also involves the rendering engine in itself.\n\n2. [JBox2D Demo](https://github.com/HaydnTrigg/JBox2D-Demo) by Hadyn Trigg. JBox2d is actually the Java code of Box2d plus\nsome additional APIs. I didn't know how to render the objects on screen in Android when i started with Box2d. The rendering\nengine in the animation is based out on this demo app.\n\n3. [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) This is the Java OpenGL Mathematics library is used to calculate matrices for OpenGL that OpenGL shaders can use to draw geometry to the screen. Its also bundled in the JBox2d demo.\n\n\nI will be publishing a blog regarding how this animaton is made and what all conecpts of physics goes into this. Please watch\nout my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@rahulraja) and my [personal blog](http://rahulrj.github.io/).\n\n\n## Next Release\n1. Click to enlarge the circles\n2. Reset Animation\n3. Swirl animation of the circles while they move.\n4. And of course a blog regarding this.\n"}, "west-mec-coding-Y1S2/S2_Project_10_02": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "west-mec-coding-Y1S2/S2_Project_10_02", "diskUsage": 336, "name": "S2_Project_10_02", "owner": {"login": "west-mec-coding-Y1S2"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "CSS"}, {"name": "HTML"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-01-29T18:04:25Z", "pushedAt": "2019-01-29T18:09:29Z", "object": {"text": "# S2_Project_10_02\nBig Apple Physics\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "628d37c6057cca6cf1005237349c1dcbea7d6620 1"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 355, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:09:30Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial Code Commit", "message": "Initial Code Commit\n\nAll student files"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:04:27Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}]}}}}, "name": "S2_Project_10_02", "owner": "west-mec-coding-Y1S2", "creation_date": "2019-01-29T18:04:25Z", "last_push_date": "2019-01-29T18:09:29Z", "commit_page_data": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "628d37c6057cca6cf1005237349c1dcbea7d6620 1"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 355, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:09:30Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial Code Commit", "message": "Initial Code Commit\n\nAll student files"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:04:27Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}]}, "has_next_page": false, "commits": [{"node": {"additions": 355, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:09:30Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial Code Commit", "message": "Initial Code Commit\n\nAll student files"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Patrick Clawson"}, "pushedDate": "2019-01-29T18:04:27Z", "messageHeadline": "Initial commit", "message": "Initial commit"}}], "total_commits": 2, "languages": ["HTML", "CSS"], "readme_text": "# S2_Project_10_02\nBig Apple Physics\n"}, "empyreanx/godot-state-sync-demo": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "empyreanx/godot-state-sync-demo", "diskUsage": 216, "name": "godot-state-sync-demo", "owner": {"login": "empyreanx"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "GDScript"}]}, "createdAt": "2015-06-05T01:42:34Z", "pushedAt": "2015-06-12T21:15:31Z", "object": {"text": "# State Synchronization Demo\n\nIn light of what I've learned since I made the [snapshot interpolation demo](https://github.com/jrimclean/godot-snapshot-interpolation-demo), I have decided to write a new demo for [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org) illustrating a technique called state synchronization. This is now my recommended approach for networked physics using Godot.\n\nBoth the client and the server run the physical simulation. State snapshots are sent from the server to the client at a high rate. The client stores the most recent update and then interpolates toward it, which has the effect of smoothing the motion of bodies in the simulation.\n\nTo start a dedicated server with the headless version of Godot type, \"godotserver -server\" in the project directory.\n\n## Features\n* Sequence checking for state updates\n* Linearly interpolated error correction for position and rotation\n* Experimental state expiration\n\n## Todo\n* Jitter buffer\n* Snap state when distance is greater than some threshold\n* Compression\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015 James McLean  \nLicensed under the

demo](https://github.com/jrimclean/godot-snapshot-interpolation-demo), I have decided to write a new demo for [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org) illustrating a technique called state synchronization. This is now my recommended approach for networked physics using Godot.\n\nBoth the client and the server run the physical simulation. State snapshots are sent from the server to the client at a high rate. The client stores the most recent update and then interpolates toward it, which has the effect of smoothing the motion of bodies in the simulation.\n\nTo start a dedicated server with the headless version of Godot type, \"godotserver -server\" in the project directory.\n\n## Features\n* Sequence checking for state updates\n* Linearly interpolated error correction for position and rotation\n* Experimental state expiration\n\n## Todo\n* Jitter buffer\n* Snap state when distance is greater than some threshold\n* Compression\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015 James McLean  \nLicensed under the

Relies on basic gravitational equations and gaussian distributions. Original credits for code go to @jzhu98. I've merely played around with the vectors, and tried to optimize the code.\n\nhw(jan:2018).ipynb - ipython code for graphs of various functions (week one homework).

It is generally themed after it, and some of the class names have that FF ring to them, so kudos if you notice and feel the influence!\n\n# Documentation\nLibraMage has two entry points for its functionality: the classes Mathga and Physicsga. Both classes are static and, in conjunction, act as LibraMage's main interface. Mathga exposes the math methods, while Physicsga exposes the physics ones.\n\n## Mathga\n#### GetCircleTangentToTwoLines\n```cs\nTangentCircleResult GetCircleTangentToTwoLines(Vector2 intersectionPoint, Vector2 firstLineUniquePoint, Vector2 secondLineUniquePoint,\n                                                            float circleRadius)\n```\nGetCircleTangentToTwoLines returns a circle that is tangent to any two non-parallel lines.\n\n* ```intersectionPoint (Vector2)``` The point where the two lines intersect.\n\n* ```firstLineUniquePoint (Vector2)``` Any point that lies on the first line and not on the second line.\n\n* ```secondLineUniquePoint (Vector2)``` Any point that lies on the second line and not on the first line.\n\n* ```circleRadius (float)``` The radius of the desired circle (an infinite number of tangent circles exists).\n\n#### GetVectorDistance2D\n```cs\nfloat GetVectorDistance2D(Vector3 vector)\n```\nGetVectorDistance2D returns the magnitude of a vector while ignoring the Z-component. Useful in 2D scenarios.\n\n* ```vector (Vector3)``` The vector to use.\n\n## Physicsga\n#### CreateTrajectoryRenderer\n```cs\nTrajectoryRenderer CreateTrajectoryRenderer(Transform parentTransform)\n```\nCreateTrajectoryRenderer automatically creates a GameObject, attaches a TrajectoryRenderer component to it, and hides it in the hierarchy for convenience. If you want to manually add the component to an existing GameObject, use AddComponent<TrajectoryRenderer>() instead.\n\n* ```parentTransform (Transform)``` The transform that should parent the trajectory renderer. In most cases, it should be the transform of the projectile itself.\n\n## Renderers\n#### TrajectoryRenderer\n\nTrajectoryRenderer is a component that predicts trajectories of moving objects and renders them in world space. Its function, appearance, and behavior are customizable according to the following properties:\n\n* ```Gravity (Vector2)``` Sets the gravity that applies to the object in question.\n\n* ```TimeStep (float)``` Sets the timestep, in seconds, between each consecutive rendered point on the trajectory. A lower timestep will render more points on the trajectory, while a higher one will render fewer points. For example, a timestep of 1 makes the renderer draw a point every 1 second in time. Lowering the timestep to 0.1 makes it draw a point every 0.1 seconds, so more points will be drawn overall.\n\n* ```LineOfSight (float)``` Sets how far along the future, in world units, will the trajectory be shown. A line of sight of 1 means the object's trajectory will be traced until it will have traversed only 1 world unit from its initial position. Increasing it to 5 will show the first 5 world units' length of its trajectory.\n\n* ```LineOfSightConstraint (DistanceMeasure)``` Sets the metric that will be used to measure the LineOfSight. \"Actual\" uses the actual distance traversed. \"Horizontal\" uses the horizontal distance traversed. \"Vertical\" uses the vertical distance traversed. By default, the metric is set to Actual.\n\n* ```LineOfSightFadeType (FadeType)``` Sets how the points themselves will fade out the further they lie on the trajectory. The closer the points are to the beginning of the trajectory, the more opaque they will be, and they get more transparent until the end of the trajectory is reached. Options are \"None\", \"Linear\", and \"Sinusoidal\". \"None\" makes all the points fully opaque. \"Linear\" makes the points fade out linearly. \"Sinusoidal\" is not yet implemented as of the latest commit. By default, it is set to \"None\". \n\n* ```Opacity (float)``` Sets the opacity of the rendered trajectory. 0 makes it fully transparent; 1 makes it fully opaque.\n\n* ```Sprite (Sprite)``` Sets the sprite of the points on the trajectory.\n\n* ```FadeInType (FadeType)``` Not to be confused with the LineOfSightFadeType, the FadeInType controls how the _entire_ trajectory fades in once it is shown using the Show() method. \"None\" makes the trajectory show at once, \"Linear\" makes it fade in linearly, and \"Sinusoidal\" is not yet supported as of the latest commit. By default, it is set to \"Linear\".\n\n* ```FadeInTime (float)``` Sets the time, in seconds, it takes the renderer to fade in. By default, it is set to 0.25 seconds.\n\n* ```FadeOutType (FadeType)``` Similar to FadeInType, but applies when the trajectory is hidden using the Hide() method.\n\n* ```FadeOutTime (float)``` Similar to FadeInTime.\n\nAfter the TrajectoryRenderer is configured, it has to be constantly notified of any initial velocity changes. Be sure to call its OnInitialVelocityUpdate(Vector2) method whenever applicable.\n\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```\nTrajectoryRenderer trajectoryRenderer = Physicsga.CreateTrajectoryRenderer(transform);\ntrajectoryRenderer.Gravity = new Vector2(0f, Constants.GRAVITY.y * GRAVITY_SCALE);\ntrajectoryRenderer.LineOfSight = 5f;\ntrajectoryRenderer.TimeStep = 0.033f;\ntrajectoryRenderer.LineOfSightFadeType = TrajectoryRenderer.FadeType.Linear;\ntrajectoryRenderer.FadeOutType = TrajectoryRenderer.FadeType.None;\ntrajectoryRenderer.Sprite = AppManager.Instance.SpriteDatabase.GetSprite(SpriteId.TrajectoryDot);\ntrajectoryRenderer.Show();\n```\n\nSomewhere in FixedUpdate:\n\n```\ntrajectoryRenderer.OnInitialVelocityUpdate((slingShotAnchorPoint - transform.position) * LAUNCH_FORCE_COEFFICIENT);\n```\n\n# Examples\nThe following are some examples of where and how I use LibraMage in my projects.\n#### Fat Bunny: Rounded Corners\n![Fat Bunny](img/GetTangentCircleExample.png)\n\nIn Fat Bunny, the lines of the mountainous terrain have rounded corners at the places where they intersect. Those rounded corners are actually part of a circle that is tangent to the sloped line and the flat line. Mathga.GetCircleTangentToTwoLines is being used to find the circle. \n\n\n#### Fat Bunny: Trajectory Prediction\n![Fat Bunny](img/TrajectoryPredictionExample.png)\n\nIn Fat Bunny, one feature we've decided to experiment with is trajectory rendering. It shows the path the bunny will follow in the air after he jumps. Physicsga.CreateTrajectoryRenderer is being used to get such a trajectory renderer."}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 16, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": false, "commitsEndCursor": "c67b3dcc690ed9c042cab40777e756eaed6c3ba3 15"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 6, "author": {"name": "Fouad Tabsh"}, "pushedDate": "2018-03-28T22:41:09Z", "messageHeadline": "Fix readme;

It is generally themed after it, and some of the class names have that FF ring to them, so kudos if you notice and feel the influence!\n\n# Documentation\nLibraMage has two entry points for its functionality: the classes Mathga and Physicsga. Both classes are static and, in conjunction, act as LibraMage's main interface. Mathga exposes the math methods, while Physicsga exposes the physics ones.\n\n## Mathga\n#### GetCircleTangentToTwoLines\n```cs\nTangentCircleResult GetCircleTangentToTwoLines(Vector2 intersectionPoint, Vector2 firstLineUniquePoint, Vector2 secondLineUniquePoint,\n                                                            float circleRadius)\n```\nGetCircleTangentToTwoLines returns a circle that is tangent to any two non-parallel lines.\n\n* ```intersectionPoint (Vector2)``` The point where the two lines intersect.\n\n* ```firstLineUniquePoint (Vector2)``` Any point that lies on the first line and not on the second line.\n\n* ```secondLineUniquePoint (Vector2)``` Any point that lies on the second line and not on the first line.\n\n* ```circleRadius (float)``` The radius of the desired circle (an infinite number of tangent circles exists).\n\n#### GetVectorDistance2D\n```cs\nfloat GetVectorDistance2D(Vector3 vector)\n```\nGetVectorDistance2D returns the magnitude of a vector while ignoring the Z-component. Useful in 2D scenarios.\n\n* ```vector (Vector3)``` The vector to use.\n\n## Physicsga\n#### CreateTrajectoryRenderer\n```cs\nTrajectoryRenderer CreateTrajectoryRenderer(Transform parentTransform)\n```\nCreateTrajectoryRenderer automatically creates a GameObject, attaches a TrajectoryRenderer component to it, and hides it in the hierarchy for convenience. If you want to manually add the component to an existing GameObject, use AddComponent<TrajectoryRenderer>() instead.\n\n* ```parentTransform (Transform)``` The transform that should parent the trajectory renderer. In most cases, it should be the transform of the projectile itself.\n\n## Renderers\n#### TrajectoryRenderer\n\nTrajectoryRenderer is a component that predicts trajectories of moving objects and renders them in world space. Its function, appearance, and behavior are customizable according to the following properties:\n\n* ```Gravity (Vector2)``` Sets the gravity that applies to the object in question.\n\n* ```TimeStep (float)``` Sets the timestep, in seconds, between each consecutive rendered point on the trajectory. A lower timestep will render more points on the trajectory, while a higher one will render fewer points. For example, a timestep of 1 makes the renderer draw a point every 1 second in time. Lowering the timestep to 0.1 makes it draw a point every 0.1 seconds, so more points will be drawn overall.\n\n* ```LineOfSight (float)``` Sets how far along the future, in world units, will the trajectory be shown. A line of sight of 1 means the object's trajectory will be traced until it will have traversed only 1 world unit from its initial position. Increasing it to 5 will show the first 5 world units' length of its trajectory.\n\n* ```LineOfSightConstraint (DistanceMeasure)``` Sets the metric that will be used to measure the LineOfSight. \"Actual\" uses the actual distance traversed. \"Horizontal\" uses the horizontal distance traversed. \"Vertical\" uses the vertical distance traversed. By default, the metric is set to Actual.\n\n* ```LineOfSightFadeType (FadeType)``` Sets how the points themselves will fade out the further they lie on the trajectory. The closer the points are to the beginning of the trajectory, the more opaque they will be, and they get more transparent until the end of the trajectory is reached. Options are \"None\", \"Linear\", and \"Sinusoidal\". \"None\" makes all the points fully opaque. \"Linear\" makes the points fade out linearly. \"Sinusoidal\" is not yet implemented as of the latest commit. By default, it is set to \"None\". \n\n* ```Opacity (float)``` Sets the opacity of the rendered trajectory. 0 makes it fully transparent; 1 makes it fully opaque.\n\n* ```Sprite (Sprite)``` Sets the sprite of the points on the trajectory.\n\n* ```FadeInType (FadeType)``` Not to be confused with the LineOfSightFadeType, the FadeInType controls how the _entire_ trajectory fades in once it is shown using the Show() method. \"None\" makes the trajectory show at once, \"Linear\" makes it fade in linearly, and \"Sinusoidal\" is not yet supported as of the latest commit. By default, it is set to \"Linear\".\n\n* ```FadeInTime (float)``` Sets the time, in seconds, it takes the renderer to fade in. By default, it is set to 0.25 seconds.\n\n* ```FadeOutType (FadeType)``` Similar to FadeInType, but applies when the trajectory is hidden using the Hide() method.\n\n* ```FadeOutTime (float)``` Similar to FadeInTime.\n\nAfter the TrajectoryRenderer is configured, it has to be constantly notified of any initial velocity changes. Be sure to call its OnInitialVelocityUpdate(Vector2) method whenever applicable.\n\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```\nTrajectoryRenderer trajectoryRenderer = Physicsga.CreateTrajectoryRenderer(transform);\ntrajectoryRenderer.Gravity = new Vector2(0f, Constants.GRAVITY.y * GRAVITY_SCALE);\ntrajectoryRenderer.LineOfSight = 5f;\ntrajectoryRenderer.TimeStep = 0.033f;\ntrajectoryRenderer.LineOfSightFadeType = TrajectoryRenderer.FadeType.Linear;\ntrajectoryRenderer.FadeOutType = TrajectoryRenderer.FadeType.None;\ntrajectoryRenderer.Sprite = AppManager.Instance.SpriteDatabase.GetSprite(SpriteId.TrajectoryDot);\ntrajectoryRenderer.Show();\n```\n\nSomewhere in FixedUpdate:\n\n```\ntrajectoryRenderer.OnInitialVelocityUpdate((slingShotAnchorPoint - transform.position) * LAUNCH_FORCE_COEFFICIENT);\n```\n\n# Examples\nThe following are some examples of where and how I use LibraMage in my projects.\n#### Fat Bunny: Rounded Corners\n![Fat Bunny](img/GetTangentCircleExample.png)\n\nIn Fat Bunny, the lines of the mountainous terrain have rounded corners at the places where they intersect. Those rounded corners are actually part of a circle that is tangent to the sloped line and the flat line. Mathga.GetCircleTangentToTwoLines is being used to find the circle. \n\n\n#### Fat Bunny: Trajectory Prediction\n![Fat Bunny](img/TrajectoryPredictionExample.png)\n\nIn Fat Bunny, one feature we've decided to experiment with is trajectory rendering. It shows the path the bunny will follow in the air after he jumps. Physicsga.CreateTrajectoryRenderer is being used to get such a trajectory renderer."}, "Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym", "diskUsage": 73110, "name": "assistive-gym", "owner": {"login": "Healthcare-Robotics"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-09-26T03:42:20Z", "pushedAt": "2020-04-23T00:58:31Z", "object": {"text": "# Assistive Gym\n\nAssistive Gym is a physics-based simulation framework for physical human-robot interaction and robotic assistance.\n\nAssistive Gym is integrated into the OpenAI Gym interface, enabling the use of existing reinforcement learning and control algorithms to teach robots how to interact with people. \n\n![Assistive Gym](images/assistive_gym.jpg \"Assistive Gym\")\n\n### Paper\nA paper on Assistive Gym can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04700\n```\n@article{erickson2020assistivegym,\n  title={Assistive Gym: A Physics Simulation Framework for Assistive Robotics},\n  author={Erickson, Zackory and Gangaram, Vamsee and Kapusta, Ariel and Liu, C.

environment.\nWe encourage installing Assistive Gym and the custom PyBullet engine in a python virtualenv.  \nA detailed description of each installation step can be found in the [Install Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/1.-Install).  \nInstallation instructions for Windows can also be found in the [Install Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/1.-Install#installing-on-windows)\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\npython3 -m venv env\nsource

with: deactivate\n```\n\n## Getting Started\nWe provide a [10 Minute Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/3.-Getting-Started) to help you get familiar with using Assistive Gym for assistive robotics research.\n\nYou can visualize the various Assistive Gym environments using the environment viewer.  \nA full list of available environment can be found [Here (Environments)](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/2.-Environments).\n```bash\npython3 env_viewer.py --env \"FeedingJaco-v0\"\n```\n\nWe provide pretrained control policies for each robot and assistive task.  \nSee [Running Pretrained Policies](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/4.-Running-Pretrained-Policies) for details on how to run a pretrained policy.\n\nSee [Training New Policies](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/5.-Training-New-Policies) for documentation on how to train new control policies for Assistive Gym environments.\n\nFinally, [Creating a New Assistive Environment](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/6.-Creating-a-New-Assistive-Environment) discusses the process of creating an Assistive Gym environment for your own human-robot interaction tasks.\n\n## Features\n### Human and robot models \nCustomizable female and male human models (default body sizes and weights matching 50th percentile humans).  \n40 actuated human joints (head, torso, arms, waist, and legs)  \n&nbsp;  \n![Human models](images/human_models.gif \"Human models\")  \n&nbsp;  \nFour collaborative robots (PR2, Jaco, Baxter, Sawyer).  \n&nbsp;  \n![Robot models](images/robot_models.gif \"Robot models\")\n### Realistic human joint limits\nBuilding off of prior research, Assistive Gym provides a model for realistic pose-dependent human joint limits.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Realistic human joint limits](images/realistic_human_joint_limits.gif \"Realistic human joint limits\")\n### Robot base pose optimization\nA robot's base pose can greatly impact the robot\u2019s ability to physically assist people.  \nWe provide a baseline method using joint-limit-weighted kinematic isotopy (JLWKI) to select good base poses near a person.  \nWith JLWKI, the robot chooses base poses (position and yaw orientation) with high manipulability near end effector goals.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Robot base pose optimization](images/robot_base_pose_optimization.gif \"Robot base pose optimization\")\n### Human preferences\nDuring assistance, a person will typically prefer for the robot not to spill water on them, or apply large forces to their body.  \nAssistive Gym provides a baseline set of human preferences unified across all tasks, which are incorporated directly into the reward function.\nThis allows robots to learn to provide assistance that is consist with a person's preferences.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Human preferences](images/human_preferences.gif \"Human preferences\")\n\nRefer to [the

Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/1.-Install).  \nInstallation instructions for Windows can also be found in the [Install Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/1.-Install#installing-on-windows)\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip3 install git+https://github.com/Zackory/bullet3.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym.git\ncd assistive-gym\npip3 install .\n# Leave virtual env with: deactivate\n```\n\n## Getting Started\nWe provide a [10 Minute Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/3.-Getting-Started) to help you get familiar with using Assistive Gym for assistive robotics research.\n\nYou can visualize the various Assistive Gym environments using the environment viewer.  \nA full list of available environment can be found [Here (Environments)](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/2.-Environments).\n```bash\npython3 env_viewer.py --env \"FeedingJaco-v0\"\n```\n\nWe provide pretrained control policies for each robot and assistive task.  \nSee [Running Pretrained Policies](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/4.-Running-Pretrained-Policies) for details on how to run a pretrained policy.\n\nSee [Training New Policies](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/5.-Training-New-Policies) for documentation on how to train new control policies for Assistive Gym environments.\n\nFinally, [Creating a New Assistive Environment](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/6.-Creating-a-New-Assistive-Environment) discusses the process of creating an Assistive Gym environment for your own human-robot interaction tasks.\n\n## Features\n### Human and robot models \nCustomizable female and male human models (default body sizes and weights matching 50th percentile humans).  \n40 actuated human joints (head, torso, arms, waist, and legs)  \n&nbsp;  \n![Human models](images/human_models.gif \"Human models\")  \n&nbsp;  \nFour collaborative robots (PR2, Jaco, Baxter, Sawyer).  \n&nbsp;  \n![Robot models](images/robot_models.gif \"Robot models\")\n### Realistic human joint limits\nBuilding off of prior research, Assistive Gym provides a model for realistic pose-dependent human joint limits.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Realistic human joint limits](images/realistic_human_joint_limits.gif \"Realistic human joint limits\")\n### Robot base pose optimization\nA robot's base pose can greatly impact the robot\u2019s ability to physically assist people.  \nWe provide a baseline method using joint-limit-weighted kinematic isotopy (JLWKI) to select good base poses near a person.  \nWith JLWKI, the robot chooses base poses (position and yaw orientation) with high manipulability near end effector goals.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Robot base pose optimization](images/robot_base_pose_optimization.gif \"Robot base pose optimization\")\n### Human preferences\nDuring assistance, a person will typically prefer for the robot not to spill water on them, or apply large forces to their body.  \nAssistive Gym provides a baseline set of human preferences unified across all tasks, which are incorporated directly into the reward function.\nThis allows robots to learn to provide assistance that is consist with a person's preferences.  \n&nbsp;  \n![Human preferences](images/human_preferences.gif \"Human preferences\")\n\nRefer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04700) for details on features in Assistive Gym.\n"}, "CodeAndWeb/phaser-p2-physics-example": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "CodeAndWeb/phaser-p2-physics-example",

simulator](opende.sf.net) to compute likely vectors of kinematic\n(joint angle) and dynamic (joint torque) information during the recorded\nmovements.

Status](https://travis-ci.com/zhaofeng-shu33/THU-coursework-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zhaofeng-shu33/THU-coursework-template)\n\nLaTeX package for students in Tsinghua University to write coursework more efficiently, also can be used by students from other university.\n\nNotice that the package itself does not import ctex package, to use it with Chinese writing, see example file `ithw.tex` for detail.\n\n## Features\n\n * support custom courseheader\n * automatic header setting\n * support coursework counter\n * definition of common math symbols\n\n## ToDo\n\n * automatic enumerate environment labeling and reference\n\n## Compile from source\n\nUse `make doc` or run the following commands one by one:\n\n    xelatex thucoursework.dtx\n    makeindex -s gind.ist -o thucoursework.ind thucoursework.idx\n    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o thucoursework.gls thucoursework.glo\n    xelatex thucoursework.dtx\n    xelatex thucoursework.dtx\n\n## Usage\n\n`\\usepackage{iidef}` and you are ready to go!\n\n## Help\n  see manual `thucoursework.pdf`\n\n## Sample File\n\n * `iihw.tex` is the homework of **Information Inference**\n * `ithw.tex` is the homework of **Information Theory**, chinese version (to make it work, use `ctex` package in user file.)\n\n## Contributors\n\n [Xiangxiang Xu](https://xiangxiangxu.com/) revised this template, zhaofeng-shu33 made it a latex package.\n\n## License\n This project is licensed by The LaTeX Project Public Li\u00adcense.\n\n\n"}, "orest-d/p4vasp": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "orest-d/p4vasp",

distributed under the General Public License version 2 (GPL2).\n\nFor more information and support visit www.p4vasp.at.\n\nBinary distributions\n==========================\n\nBinary distribution contains a single executable file.\nPlace this file at a convenient location (e.g. Desktop)\nand add it to the system PATH.\nP4vasp is a portable application - it can be started from a usb drive.\n\n\nSource-code distributions\n==========================\n\nCompilation Quickstart\n--------------------------\n\nFor local installation run:\n```\n   $ ./install-local.sh\n```\n\nFor global installation run:\n```\n   $ ./install.sh\n```\n\nInstallation (local)\n--------------------------\n\n1) Make sure you have all the dependencies.\n   In Ubuntu you can do it with a supplied script: `install/install-ubuntu-dependencies.sh`\n2) If there are previous versions of p4vasp, uninstall them.\n   You can do it with the `uninstall.sh` residing in the `P4VASP_HOME` directory.\n3) Unpack the file:                \n```\n   $ tar -xvzf p4vasp-x.x.x.tgz\n```\n4) Change directory:               \n```\n   $ cd p4vasp-x.x.x\n```\n5) Configure:                      \n```\n   $ make local\n```\n6) check and adjust the paths in `install/Configuration.mk`\n7) Install:                        \n```\n   $ make install\n```\n8) Add path to p4v in the .bashrc  \n```\n   $ make bashrc\n```\n\n\nInstallation (global)\n--------------------------\n\n1) Make sure you have all the dependencies.\n   In Ubuntu you can do it with a supplied script: `install/install-ubuntu-dependencies.sh`\n2) Uninstall the old version (as root):\n                        This usually (depending on your installation) can be done with an uninstall script:\n```                        \n   $ sudo bash /usr/lib/p4vasp/uninstall.sh\n```\n3) Unpack the file:     \n```\n   $ tar -xvzf p4vasp-x.x.x.tgz\n```\n4) Change directory:    \n```\n   $ cd p4vasp-x.x.x\n```\n5) Configure:           \n```\n   $ make config\n```\n6) install (as root):   \n```\n   $ make install\n```\n7) If something goes wrong\n   - Run the diagnostic.py script, it may provide you with some hints.\n   - Check FAQ\n   - We can try to help you if you visit forum at www.p4vasp.at, please provide us with the output from diagnostic.py.\n\n\n\nInstallation (MacOS)\n--------------------------\n1) You will need X11 and the command-line tools for Xcode.\n   For Xquratz(X11), visit [their website](https://www.xquartz.org/)\n   For command-line tools: \t\t\n```\n   $ xcode-select --install\n```\n\n2) For FLTK installation, we use homebrew's fltk:\n   Install homebrew: \t\t\t\n```\n   $ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n```\n   Install fltk: \t\t\t\n```\n   $ brew install fltk\n```\n\n3) Install other necessary library:\t\n```\n   $ brew install python@2 pip gcc gtk+ pygtk \u2014with-libglade && pip install pyopengl numpy\n```\n4) Apply patch to the sourcefile:\t\n```\n   $ patch -p0 -i MacOS.patch\n```\n5) Copy the Makefile.MacOS to Makefile in the p4vasp root directory and in the `src` and `odpdom` directory:\n```\n   $ cp Makefile.MacOS Makefile\n   $ cp odpdom/Makefile.MacOS odpdom/Makefile\n   $ cp src/Makefile.MacOS src/Makefile\n```\n6) Run make and install:\n```\n   $ make local && make && make install\n```\n7) The executable should located at

Engine\n======================================================\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nThis is a fork of irrBullet, which can be found <a href=\"https://irrbullet.svn.sourceforge.net/\">here</a>. \n\nIt is an updated version of irrBullet which works with Irrlicht 1.8.1 and latest SVN branch (unstable) and Bullet 2.83. It also has several improvements over outdated irrBullet. I tried contacting the original author of irrBullet, but got no response.\n\nNote: The following version hasn't released yet and maybe unstable. If you find any bug, then please open an issue in issues tracker. Thanks.\n\nWhat's new in 0.1.9\n-------------------\n* Performance improvement (refactored loops, replaced Irrlicht's containers with STL, add move semantics etc)\n* Several bug fixes\n* Support for latest versions of Bullet and Irrlicht\n* ICapsuleShape and ICylinderShape added\n* IRigidBody, irrBulletWorld etc are feature complete (all methods have been wrapped)\n* Strong C++11 support - dropped support for non-C++11 compilers\n* irrBullet is forked - now maintained by Danyal Zia\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n(Note: Only Linux supported at the moment)\n\nOpen `Makefile` and change the value of `IrrlichtHome` and `BulletHome` to the root directory of Irrlicht and Bullet respectively, and simply run \"make\" to compile the library.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nIt is released under permissive zlib license same as Bullet and Irrlicht.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 36, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor":

Engine\n======================================================\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nThis is a fork of irrBullet, which can be found <a href=\"https://irrbullet.svn.sourceforge.net/\">here</a>. \n\nIt is an updated version of irrBullet which works with Irrlicht 1.8.1 and latest SVN branch (unstable) and Bullet 2.83. It also has several improvements over outdated irrBullet. I tried contacting the original author of irrBullet, but got no response.\n\nNote: The following version hasn't released yet and maybe unstable. If you find any bug, then please open an issue in issues tracker. Thanks.\n\nWhat's new in 0.1.9\n-------------------\n* Performance improvement (refactored loops, replaced Irrlicht's containers with STL, add move semantics etc)\n* Several bug fixes\n* Support for latest versions of Bullet and Irrlicht\n* ICapsuleShape and ICylinderShape added\n* IRigidBody, irrBulletWorld etc are feature complete (all methods have been wrapped)\n* Strong C++11 support - dropped support for non-C++11 compilers\n* irrBullet is forked - now maintained by Danyal Zia\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n(Note: Only Linux supported at the moment)\n\nOpen `Makefile` and change the value of `IrrlichtHome` and `BulletHome` to the root directory of Irrlicht and Bullet respectively, and simply run \"make\" to compile the library.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nIt is released under permissive zlib license same as Bullet and Irrlicht.\n"}, "asadm/SPHjs": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "asadm/SPHjs", "diskUsage": 30, "name": "SPHjs", "owner": {"login": "asadm"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "JavaScript"}, {"name": "HTML"}]}, "createdAt": "2014-03-16T15:43:13Z", "pushedAt": "2020-01-20T18:43:05Z", "object": {"text": "SPHjs - Fluid/Water simulation is JavaScript.\n=============================================\n\n## Demo\nCheck the live version here: http://jsexperiments.herokuapp.com/sph/\n\n\n## Getting started\n* Clone or Download the repo.\n* Run the index.html through any webserver.

Use Chrome, Safari - or a mobile device (preferred).\n\n####USAGE: Check the src/www/index.html - or the Codepen demo.\n\nLoad the required js (**Ionic**, then `velocity.js`, `velocity.ui.js` and `liquidfun.js`).\n\nAfter them, load NUI: `nui.ionic.js` and `nui.ionic.box2d.js`.\n\nAdd an attribute (`nui-tiltable`, `nui-touchable` or `nui-body`) to some element in your html. That's it.\n\nUse at your own risk, this is an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for now and things will change. Documentation coming later.\n\n---------------\n\n####Goals:\n* Enable the end user to directly manipulate, drag, and throw any UI element,\n* using touch and multi-touch with inertia, plus tilting/orienting the device.\n* Let elements interact with each others, using natural and intuitive phenomena from physics.\n* Make this very easy for anyone to implement in code. No canvas, just plain DOM elements. Declarative, i.e. an element is declared to be tiltable by an HTML attribute > it starts reacting to the device orientation.\n\n\n---------------\n\nWe are testing these principles using [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/). \nIonic is a great framework, enabling rapid building of (web apps and) iOS and Android apps.\n\nWe want to build NUI in form of **Angular/Ionic modules**. The modules enable declaring any DOM element to respond to drag and multi-touch, accelerometer input or calculations from a 2D physics engine: gravity, collisions, inertia, friction and several others. We are still figuring out the best ways to wire up everything - to include joints, triggers and events easily.\n\n##Natural UI\nFrom CLI to GUI, and now to NUI\n\nCLI is based on remembering the commands.\n\nGUI is symbolic, turn-based or sequential. The user is presented with all the options in a symbolic form, such as a button representing a tool to scale something. The interaction consists of little tasks in form of request - response between the user and the UI. The conversation between the user and the device is sequential and indirect.\nThe interface is abstract, the user might be moving a mouse on a table to move a pointer elsewhere to click an icon representing a zoom tool.\n\nNUI is about engaging the users by intuitive direct manipulation.\n\nHere's an inspiring list of the 'Eight Principles of Natural User Interfaces' by [Rachel Hinman](http://designprinciplesftw.com/collections/eight-principles-of-natural-user-interfaces):\n\n1. **Performance Aesthetics** - The joy of doing: the pleasure comes from the *flow of the interaction*, not the accomplishment of each task like in traditional GUI.\n2. **Direct Manipulation** - Physically touching and manipulating information with fingertips or other direct means, without an aid such as a mouse. \n3. **Scaffolding** - Scaffolding is a strong cue or guide that sets users\u2019 expectations by giving them an indication of how the interaction will unfold.\n4. **Contextual Environments** - Responsive to the context, suggesting what the next interaction could be.\n5. **The Super Real** - The UI elements not only feel real, but we also perceive them to be *super real* as their character can change in a way that is almost magical.\n6. **Social Interaction** - UI should be streamlined, enabling more opportunities for users to engage and interact with other users instead of the system\u2019s interface.\n7. **Spatial Relationships** - Represent information as such, as objects - not symbols of the information.\n8. **Seamlessness** - Sensors, and the use of gestural UI's enable interactions to feel seamless. There are fewer barriers between the user and information.\n\n\n###Multi-touch and other inputs\n\n**Abstraction for UI design:**\n\nInput:  one or more touches, x and y. Hammer.js used by Ionic can track many touches simultaneously - take a look at  'touches' under the event when doing a pinch or rotate with many fingers. Accelerometer data. Effect from other elements via collisions, and links such as hinges and springs.\n\nOutput: transform a DOM element by any combo of 'translateX', 'translateY', 'translateZ', 'rotateX','rotateY','rotateZ','scale', 'scaleX','scaleY'. Apply multipliers (magnitude and reversing effects) and functions.\n\nTriggering events during and after to chain actions would be great.\n\n###Physics\nTo make elements behave in a natural way, plain CSS animations and transitions are not enough.\nWe feel a physics engine is needed even for an UI.\n\nA physics engine calculates the interactions using real properties. Many projects link this with an external renderer to draw the results on a HTML5 canvas element. In this project, we intend to test linking the engine with plain DOM elements, to better use the frameworks like Angular and Ionic.\n\n####Engine\nVersion 0.0.1 used the old Box2 ([Box2dWeb](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/wiki/BasicUsage)).\nIt was small and worked well, but version 0.0.2 is the first attempt to test [LiquidFun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/). Maybe also test something completely different later (native js or even 3d). The goal is to maintain the Ionic side the same, the physics engine can be replaced.\n\nLiquidFun enables particles, liquids and elastic bodies while maintaining **some** compatibility with Box2D. Several things had to be changed to make it work.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 47, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "ebce7bba3be58cc04349c03de4530f44e773b3c5 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Mikko K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen"}, "pushedDate": "2014-10-23T17:17:31Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2, "author": {"name": "Mikko K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen"}, "pushedDate": "2014-10-21T14:58:21Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 4, "author": {"name": "Mikko K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen"}, "pushedDate": "2014-10-17T14:10:17Z", "messageHeadline": "Update README.md", "message": "Update README.md"}}, {"node": {"additions": 228, "author": {"name": "Mikko Kamarainen"}, "pushedDate": "2014-10-17T13:58:26Z", "messageHeadline": "Add build", "message": "Add build"}}, {"node": {"additions": 87, "author": {"name": "Mikko Kamarainen"}, "pushedDate": "2014-10-17T13:56:29Z", "messageHeadline": "Version 0.0.2 - LiquidFun instead of Box2D", "message": "Version 0.0.2 - LiquidFun instead of Box2D\n\nSwitched to LiquidFun.

Use Chrome, Safari - or a mobile device (preferred).\n\n####USAGE: Check the src/www/index.html - or the Codepen demo.\n\nLoad the required js (**Ionic**, then `velocity.js`, `velocity.ui.js` and `liquidfun.js`).\n\nAfter them, load NUI: `nui.ionic.js` and `nui.ionic.box2d.js`.\n\nAdd an attribute (`nui-tiltable`, `nui-touchable` or `nui-body`) to some element in your html. That's it.\n\nUse at your own risk, this is an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) for now and things will change. Documentation coming later.\n\n---------------\n\n####Goals:\n* Enable the end user to directly manipulate, drag, and throw any UI element,\n* using touch and multi-touch with inertia, plus tilting/orienting the device.\n* Let elements interact with each others, using natural and intuitive phenomena from physics.\n* Make this very easy for anyone to implement in code. No canvas, just plain DOM elements. Declarative, i.e. an element is declared to be tiltable by an HTML attribute > it starts reacting to the device orientation.\n\n\n---------------\n\nWe are testing these principles using [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/). \nIonic is a great framework, enabling rapid building of (web apps and) iOS and Android apps.\n\nWe want to build NUI in form of **Angular/Ionic modules**. The modules enable declaring any DOM element to respond to drag and multi-touch, accelerometer input or calculations from a 2D physics engine: gravity, collisions, inertia, friction and several others. We are still figuring out the best ways to wire up everything - to include joints, triggers and events easily.\n\n##Natural UI\nFrom CLI to GUI, and now to NUI\n\nCLI is based on remembering the commands.\n\nGUI is symbolic, turn-based or sequential. The user is presented with all the options in a symbolic form, such as a button representing a tool to scale something. The interaction consists of little tasks in form of request - response between the user and the UI. The conversation between the user and the device is sequential and indirect.\nThe interface is abstract, the user might be moving a mouse on a table to move a pointer elsewhere to click an icon representing a zoom tool.\n\nNUI is about engaging the users by intuitive direct manipulation.\n\nHere's an inspiring list of the 'Eight Principles of Natural User Interfaces' by [Rachel Hinman](http://designprinciplesftw.com/collections/eight-principles-of-natural-user-interfaces):\n\n1. **Performance Aesthetics** - The joy of doing: the pleasure comes from the *flow of the interaction*, not the accomplishment of each task like in traditional GUI.\n2. **Direct Manipulation** - Physically touching and manipulating information with fingertips or other direct means, without an aid such as a mouse. \n3. **Scaffolding** - Scaffolding is a strong cue or guide that sets users\u2019 expectations by giving them an indication of how the interaction will unfold.\n4. **Contextual Environments** - Responsive to the context, suggesting what the next interaction could be.\n5. **The Super Real** - The UI elements not only feel real, but we also perceive them to be *super real* as their character can change in a way that is almost magical.\n6. **Social Interaction** - UI should be streamlined, enabling more opportunities for users to engage and interact with other users instead of the system\u2019s interface.\n7. **Spatial Relationships** - Represent information as such, as objects - not symbols of the information.\n8. **Seamlessness** - Sensors, and the use of gestural UI's enable interactions to feel seamless. There are fewer barriers between the user and information.\n\n\n###Multi-touch and other inputs\n\n**Abstraction for UI design:**\n\nInput:  one or more touches, x and y. Hammer.js used by Ionic can track many touches simultaneously - take a look at  'touches' under the event when doing a pinch or rotate with many fingers. Accelerometer data. Effect from other elements via collisions, and links such as hinges and springs.\n\nOutput: transform a DOM element by any combo of 'translateX', 'translateY', 'translateZ', 'rotateX','rotateY','rotateZ','scale', 'scaleX','scaleY'. Apply multipliers (magnitude and reversing effects) and functions.\n\nTriggering events during and after to chain actions would be great.\n\n###Physics\nTo make elements behave in a natural way, plain CSS animations and transitions are not enough.\nWe feel a physics engine is needed even for an UI.\n\nA physics engine calculates the interactions using real properties. Many projects link this with an external renderer to draw the results on a HTML5 canvas element. In this project, we intend to test linking the engine with plain DOM elements, to better use the frameworks like Angular and Ionic.\n\n####Engine\nVersion 0.0.1 used the old Box2 ([Box2dWeb](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/wiki/BasicUsage)).\nIt was small and worked well, but version 0.0.2 is the first attempt to test [LiquidFun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/). Maybe also test something completely different later (native js or even 3d). The goal is to maintain the Ionic side the same, the physics engine can be replaced.\n\nLiquidFun enables particles, liquids and elastic bodies while maintaining **some** compatibility with Box2D. Several things had to be changed to make it work.\n"}, "PredictiveIntelligenceLab/USNCCM15-Short-Course-Recent-Advances-in-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "PredictiveIntelligenceLab/USNCCM15-Short-Course-Recent-Advances-in-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning", "diskUsage": 52073, "name": "USNCCM15-Short-Course-Recent-Advances-in-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning", "owner": {"login": "PredictiveIntelligenceLab"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Jupyter Notebook"}, {"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-07-22T14:40:15Z", "pushedAt": "2019-07-28T12:40:32Z", "object": {"text": "![](./images/schedule.png)\n\n# USNCCM15 Short Course: Recent-Advances-in-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning ([Link](http://15.usnccm.org/sc15-009))\n\n### Instructors:\n- [Dr. Paris Perdikaris](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=237) (University of Pennsylvania)\n- [Dr. Maziar Raissi](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mraissi/) (NVIDIA)\n\n### Overview:\n\nAdvances in machine learning are continuously penetrating computational science and engineering. In this course we plan to review recent advances in deep learning with a particular focus on the development of data-driven algorithms for model discovery, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification in physical and engineering systems.\n\nIn this course we will (i) present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning tools including feed-forward/convolutional/recurrent neural networks, variational auto-encoders, and generative adversarial networks, (ii) show how these data-driven models can be constrained to encode physical priors and domain knowledge, (iii) demonstrate how they can help us distill \"hidden physics\" from raw data and construct scalable and predictive surrogate models, (iv) provide a collection of diverse applications in computational science, including both forward and inverse problems in the presence of uncertainty.\n\nOur goals for this course are threefold: (i) cover fundamental methodological and algorithmic concepts, (ii) showcase a collection of practical applications, and (iii) design a series of hands-on tutorials that will illustrate key practical and implementation aspects. Attendees will leave this course with a well-rounded understanding of the capabilities brought by deep learning in a wide range of applications in computational science and engineering. They will also sharpen their hands-on skills and familiarize themselves with how to adapt these tools to their respective application domains.\n\n\n## Setting up your computing environment\n\nTo follow the hands-on tutorials, please make sure you have the following software properly installed and working on your computer:\n- A Python 3 distrubution configured for scientific computing. The simplest way to set this up is by installing the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) distribution.\n- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). If you have access to GPU hardware, make sure you install a version with GPU support.\n- [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). You will need this in order to follow some of the in-class tutorials.\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will need this in order to download and stay in sync with the latest code we will develop in class.\n\n## A primer on Tensorflow\n\nTo best follow the hands-on tutorials, attendeed are expected to be familiar with basic concepts in Tensorflow programming (e.g., computational graphs, placeholders, automatic differentiation). New users are encouraged to study the tutorials presented [here](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).\n\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 14, "pageInfo":

Recent-Advances-in-Physics-Informed-Deep-Learning ([Link](http://15.usnccm.org/sc15-009))\n\n### Instructors:\n- [Dr. Paris Perdikaris](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=237) (University of Pennsylvania)\n- [Dr. Maziar Raissi](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mraissi/) (NVIDIA)\n\n### Overview:\n\nAdvances in machine learning are continuously penetrating computational science and engineering. In this course we plan to review recent advances in deep learning with a particular focus on the development of data-driven algorithms for model discovery, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification in physical and engineering systems.\n\nIn this course we will (i) present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning tools including feed-forward/convolutional/recurrent neural networks, variational auto-encoders, and generative adversarial networks, (ii) show how these data-driven models can be constrained to encode physical priors and domain knowledge, (iii) demonstrate how they can help us distill \"hidden physics\" from raw data and construct scalable and predictive surrogate models, (iv) provide a collection of diverse applications in computational science, including both forward and inverse problems in the presence of uncertainty.\n\nOur goals for this course are threefold: (i) cover fundamental methodological and algorithmic concepts, (ii) showcase a collection of practical applications, and (iii) design a series of hands-on tutorials that will illustrate key practical and implementation aspects. Attendees will leave this course with a well-rounded understanding of the capabilities brought by deep learning in a wide range of applications in computational science and engineering. They will also sharpen their hands-on skills and familiarize themselves with how to adapt these tools to their respective application domains.\n\n\n## Setting up your computing environment\n\nTo follow the hands-on tutorials, please make sure you have the following software properly installed and working on your computer:\n- A Python 3 distrubution configured for scientific computing. The simplest way to set this up is by installing the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) distribution.\n- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). If you have access to GPU hardware, make sure you install a version with GPU support.\n- [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). You will need this in order to follow some of the in-class tutorials.\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will need this in order to download and stay in sync with the latest code we will develop in class.\n\n## A primer on Tensorflow\n\nTo best follow the hands-on tutorials, attendeed are expected to be familiar with basic concepts in Tensorflow programming (e.g., computational graphs, placeholders, automatic differentiation). New users are encouraged to study the tutorials presented [here](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).\n\n"}, "blackberry/Bullet": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "blackberry/Bullet", "diskUsage": 12079, "name": "Bullet", "owner": {"login": "blackberry"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C++"}, {"name": "Lua"}, {"name": "C"}, {"name": "Logos"}, {"name": "JavaScript"}, {"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "Python"}, {"name": "Objective-C"}]}, "createdAt": "2011-10-13T05:35:46Z", "pushedAt": "2013-04-15T13:47:36Z", "object": {"text": "# Bullet v2.8\n\nThe _**Bullet**_ repository holds the sources for the Bullet, a professional free 3D game multi-physics library.
