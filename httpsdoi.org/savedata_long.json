{"BergmannLab/MONET": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "BergmannLab/MONET", "diskUsage": 72132, "name": "MONET", "owner": {"login": "BergmannLab"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Dockerfile"}, {"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "Python"}, {"name": "R"}, {"name": "C++"}, {"name": "Makefile"}, {"name": "GAP"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-05-14T12:53:00Z", "pushedAt": "2020-04-29T06:26:55Z", "object": {"text": "# MONET\n\nThis repository holds the source code for **MONET**, a Linux/MacOS command-line toolbox to mine molecular and genetic networks, leveraging the top performing methods of the **Disease Module Identification (DMI) DREAM Challenge** (see DREAM Challenge paper under section PUBLICATIONS and https://www.synapse.org/modulechallenge)\n\n## PREREQUISITES\n\n**Operating System**: MONET can be run on **either**\n* Linux (it was tested on *Ubuntu Linux* 18.04, *CentOS Linux* 7.5)\n* MacOS (it was tested on *macOS Sierra* 10.12)\n\n**Software**: MONET requires **either**:\n* ```Docker``` (see https://www.docker.com)\n* ```Singularity``` (see http://singularity.lbl.gov)\n\n**Hardware**: MONET was tested both on server and on commodity hardware (i.e., regular desktop). For details, please refer to section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES below.\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\n**Just like you can ```ls``` a folder, after installation will be able to ```monet``` a network** from any location on your system.\n\nSimply run:\n\n```$ git clone https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET.git && cd MONET && ./install.sh```\n\nA folder MONET will have been created with the source code: you are free to remove it, if you are not interested. This will not affect MONET, which has now been installed in your system: the command ```monet``` can be invoked from any location on the system.\n\n#### IF YOU NEED SOME MORE GUIDANCE\n\nYou can follow this [survey-tutorial](https://form.jotform.com/tomasonimattia/monet-installation):\n* it will guide you step by step (assumes no prior knowledge)\n* (optionally) guides you through running some examples (feel free to skip those)\n* it will help us collect information about possible errors on different platforms\n\n#### IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS\n\nUsers using Windows are encouraged to install a hypervisor (i.e., a software that allows to creates and run virtual machines): for example, install VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and configure it up to run a virtual Ubuntu Linux inside which to install MONET (using the instructions above).\n\n#### IF YOU ARE A SINGULARITY USER WITHOUT SUDO RIGHTS\n\nSudo rights will be required at installation time for Singularity users: Singularity users will not need sudo rights while running MONET (i.e., Singularity does not require sudo right to run containers), but they will need it at installation time (i.e., at the time the Singularity images are first created). \n\nUsers that don't have sudo rights should follow the regular installation procedure explained above, then refer to MONET/docs/installation_no_sudo.txt where they will find a workaround to complete the installation manually without needing sudo.\n\n## TESTING THE INSTALLATION\n\nAt the end of the install process, you will be asked whether you want to test MONET. This test is completely automatic.\n\n## MONET HELP COMMAND\n\nAfter installing MONET, the help command ```monet --help``` will be available from any location on your system.\n\n## RUNNING\n\nOnce installed, from any location on your system, you can run the following example command: it will run a method called M1 (see section METHODS for details), on a network contained in your /tmp folder (see section INPUT for details), using docker virtualization (see section PREREQUISITES for details). In the remainder of this document, you will find details about what parameters you can use, what to expect as an output and resource usage (in the PARAMETERS, OUTPUT and COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES sections respectively).\n\n```$ monet --help```\n\n```$ monet --input=/tmp/input_network.txt \u2014-method=M1 --container=docker```\n\n## INPUT\n\nThe input file is provided to MONET using the ```--input``` parameter (see section RUNNING and section PARAMETERS).\n\nThe format for the input network is the following: a **tab-separated** file containing one line for each edge. \n\nIf an edge is connecting two nodes, gene_a and gene_b, with a certain weight, the file will contain the line:\n\n```gene_a \\t gene_b \\t weight \\n```\n\nDetails:\n* gene_a and gene_b, the gene ids, can be either *string* or *integer*\n* weight can be of type *integer* or *float*\n* \"\\t\" indicates the tab character and \"\\n\" the newline character\n* no blank spaces should appear, neither as separators nor as part of the gene ids\n\nFor an example, see MONET/.test/system_test/input/zachary_karate_club.txt. The same folder containing the actual inputs to the Disease Module Identification (DMI) DREAM Challenge. Beware that some of the inputs will require high amounts of computational resources and are not suited to be run on a simple laptop or desktop computer; please refer to section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES for details.\n\n## OUTPUT\n\nThe output location is provided to MONET using the ```--output``` parameter (see section OPTIONAL PARAMETERS).\n\nTwo output files will be generated in the directory where you run the command. They are marked with a timestamp, the name of the selected method and the name of your input network. For example, let's assume if you run M1 on 1st January 2020 at midday on a file called input_network.txt:\n* a **console-output** file, which will contain the run-time outputs generated by the method you have selected, providing details about the steps that the M1 algorithm took to generate your output. Any errors would also be redirected here. The file would be called: ```2020-01-01-120000__M1__console-output__input_network.txt```\n* a **result-modules** file, containing the results of your analysis and it will not be generated in case of errors. The file would be called: ```2020-01-01-120000__M1__result-modules__input_network.txt```. It will be in tab-separated format, containing one module per line:\n  * the first value of each line will be a module identifier (in the form of an integer number starting from 1)\n  * the second is a fixed numerical value and can be ignored (curerntly set to ```1.0```, it was originally used in the DREAM Challenge to provide module-level confidence scores)\n  * the rest of the values on the line will be the gene ids container in the input (like gene_a and gene_b, see section INPUT)\n\n## METHODS\n\nThree methods are available as part of MONET, which emerged as the top-performing methods of the DREAM Challenge.\n\nIn order to run one of the three methods, adapt the example command provided in section RUNNING providing the --method option with the name of the chosen method (--method=[K1|M1|R1], for details, see section PARAMETERS).\n\n* **K1**: KERNEL CLUSTERING OPTIMISATION algorithm. K1 is based on the \u201cDiffusion State Distance\u201d (DSD), a novel graph metric which is built on the premise that paths through low-degree nodes are stronger indications of functional similarity than paths that traverse high degree nodes by Cao et al. (2014). The DSD metric is used to define a pairwise distance matrix between all nodes, on which a spectral clustering algorithm is applied. In parallel, dense bipartite sub-graphs are identified using standard graph techniques. Finally, results are merged into a single set of non-overlapping clusters. For further details, please see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7349492/wiki/407359\n* **M1**: MODULARITY OPTIMIZATION algorithm. M1 employs an original technique named Multiresolution introduced by (Arenas et al., 2008) to explore all topological scales at which modules may be found. The novelty of this approach relies on the introduction of a parameter, called resistance, which controls the aversion of nodes to form modules. Modularity (Newman and Girvan, 2004; Arenas et al., 2007) is optimized using an ensemble of algorithms: Extremal optimization (Duch and Arenas, 2005), Spectral optimization (Newman, 2006), Fast algorithm (Newman, 2004), Tabu search (Arenas et al., 2008), and fine-tuning by iterative repositioning of individual nodes in adjacent modules. For further details, please see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7352969/wiki/407384\n* **R1**: RANDOM-WALK-BASED algorithm. R1 is based on a variant of Markov Cluster Algorithm known as balanced Multi-layer Regularized Markov Cluster Algorithm(bMLRMCL) (Satuluriet al., 2010) which scales well to large graphs and minimizes the number of oversized clusters. First, a pre-processing step is applied so that edges with low weights are discarded and all remaining edges are scaled to integer values. Then, bMLRMCL is applied iteratively on modules of size grater than a user-defined threshold. For further details, please see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7286597/wiki/406659\n\n## PARAMETERS\n\nPlease, provide values for the following MANDATORY parameters:\n* **--input**: path to the network file to be analysed\n* **--method**: method to be used to analyse the input: [K1|M1|R1]\n* **--container**: virtualisation technology available on the system: [docker|singularity]\n\n## OPTIONAL PARAMETERS\n\n* **--output**: directory in which to output results (default is current directory)\n\n**if you select K1** as a method, you may additionally provide the following: \n\n* **--nclusters**: initial number of output clusters for spectral clustering step; final number may differ (default is 100)\n\n**if you select M1** as a method, you may additionally provide the following: \n\n* **--smallest**: min size of output clusters (default is 3)\n* **--largest**: max size of output clusters (default is 100)\n* **--linksdir**: directionality of links: [undirected|directed] (default is undirected)\n* **--avgk**: desired average degree for nodes in output (default is 25)\n\n**if you select R1** as a method, you may additionally provide the following: \n\n* **--smallest**: min size of output clusters (default is 3)\n* **--largest**: max size of output clusters (default is 100)\n* **--c**: trade-off parameter for computational efficiency; for larger c, the algorithm will run slower, but may provide more accurate results (default is 800)\n* **--i**: inflation parameter for standard Markov Clustering algorithm on which R1 is based (default is 2)\n* **--b**: parameter controlling how balanced the clustering results should be; for b=0, R1 behaves like standard Regularized Markov Cluster (default is 2)\n* **--threshold**: remove edges smaller than threshold from the input (default is 4)\n* **--post**: decide whether to recursively cluster (recluster) or discard too large output clusters: [recluster|discard] (default is discard)\n* **--c2**: (only used if --post=recluster) sets --c for reclustering round (default is 500)\n* **--i2**: (only used if --post=recluster) sets --i for reclustering round (default is 2)\n* **--b2**: (only used if --post=recluster) sets --b for reclustering round (default is 2)\n\n## COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES\n\nSome of the methods require large amount of resources, depending on your input (please, refer to the MONET paper in the PUBLICATIONS section for details about how resource needs will scale with the size of the input, for the different methods). \n\nTo reproduce the results of the DREAM Challenge, you can run MONET/.test/system_test/reproduce_challenge/reproduce_challenge.sh. This might fail on commodity hardware (i.e., a regular laptop or desktop) as about 8GB or RAM need to be available. In that case, you can allocate a larger SWAP partition (on Linux) or run the experiment on more powerful hardware, such as a server. Please browser the rest of the contents of MONET/.test/system_test/reproduce_challenge to view the exact RAM usage (ram_usage.txt) and the challenge outputs produced by MONET (disease_modules_output directory).\n\nTo monitor resource usage when running on your own input (and thus determine the amount or RAM / swap needed by your particular input network for a particular method), two simple scripts have been added to MONET/.test/helper_scripts (for Unix and one for MacOS systems): launch them before execution of MONET and redirect their output to file for simple inspection (no other task should be running).\n\n## BENCHMARKING\n\nFor details about the modularization performance of the MONET methods on a set of artificial benchmarks (Louvain algorithm is shown as a baseline), please refer to the MONET paper in the PUBLICATIONS section; in particular, Fig. 1. MONET/.test/benchmarking for a detailed output of the experiments that have been carried out.\n\n## SOURCE CODE\n\nThe source code is hosted at: https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET.git\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to MONET, we encourage you to get in touch! We will be happy to add you to the list of our developers https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET/graphs/contributors. **THANK YOU!**\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - CREATING A BRANCH**\n\nFirst, we will create an issue for the specific feature you are willing to contribute; let's say yours will happen to be issue 999. You will be then asked to create a new git branch where to implement your changes; run the following from the cloned MONET directory: \n\n```$ git checkout -b issues_999```\n\n```$ git push origin issues_999```\n\nAt this point, you are free to make changes to your local code in your laptop. Don't worry if you mess things up, it's no problem to add mistakes to a branch.\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - TESTING YOUR CHANGES**\n\nOnce you are done with your changes, you can test them locally by **reinstalling** from the modified MONET directory.\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - PUBLISHING YOUR CHANGES**\n\nOnce you have tested your changes, run the following from the cloned MONET directory:\n\n```$ git add .```\n\n```$ git commit -m \"adding code for feature # issues_999\"```\n\n```$ git push --set-upstream origin issues_999```\n\n```$ git checkout master```\n\nOne of the MONET developers will test the changes in your branch then merge to Master. \n\n## IMPLEMENTING LOCAL CHANGES TO MONET\n\nIf you wish to implement local changes to MONET, independently from our github repository, you can simply modify the code in your local cloned repository and **reinstall** after having made those changes (i.e. run or re-run the ```install.sh``` script and confirm if you are asked to reinstall). This procedure can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON PROBLEMS\n\nIf a MONET run is suddenly interrupted or if the expected outputs has not been generated, here are few common problems that can occur:\n* lack of RAM: if the console-output file (see section OUTPUT) contains the word \"Killed\", the MONET processed were stopped by the Operating System, likely due to a lack of RAM. To confirm this, please read section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES to learn how to monitor your resource usage while running MONET.\n* outdated kernel: Singularity users that work on Linux distributions with old kernels (e.g. CentOS 6.1, kernel 2.6) will encounter trouble during the install process; they need to contact their system administrator to inquire whether a kernel upgrade is possible.\n* can't implement local changes: please, refer to section IMPLEMENTING LOCAL CHANGES TO MONET.\n\n## BUG-REPORTS\n\nPlease, address your questions and bug reports to Mattia Tomasoni, <mattia.tomasoni AT unil.ch>. An issue will be opened here to address your problem: https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET/issues\n\n## PUBLICATIONS\n\n* **MONET paper**: Mattia Tomasoni, Sergio G\u00f3mez, Jake Crawford, Weijia Zhang, Sarvenaz Choobdar, Daniel Marbach and Sven Bergmann.

"readme_text": "# MONET\n\nThis repository holds the source code for **MONET**, a Linux/MacOS command-line toolbox to mine molecular and genetic networks, leveraging the top performing methods of the **Disease Module Identification (DMI) DREAM Challenge** (see DREAM Challenge paper under section PUBLICATIONS and https://www.synapse.org/modulechallenge)\n\n## PREREQUISITES\n\n**Operating System**: MONET can be run on **either**\n* Linux (it was tested on *Ubuntu Linux* 18.04, *CentOS Linux* 7.5)\n* MacOS (it was tested on *macOS Sierra* 10.12)\n\n**Software**: MONET requires **either**:\n* ```Docker``` (see https://www.docker.com)\n* ```Singularity``` (see http://singularity.lbl.gov)\n\n**Hardware**: MONET was tested both on server and on commodity hardware (i.e., regular desktop). For details, please refer to section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES below.\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\n**Just like you can ```ls``` a folder, after installation will be able to ```monet``` a network** from any location on your system.\n\nSimply run:\n\n```$ git clone https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET.git && cd MONET && ./install.sh```\n\nA folder MONET will have been created with the source code: you are free to remove it, if you are not interested. This will not affect MONET, which has now been installed in your system: the command ```monet``` can be invoked from any location on the system.\n\n#### IF YOU NEED SOME MORE GUIDANCE\n\nYou can follow this [survey-tutorial](https://form.jotform.com/tomasonimattia/monet-installation):\n* it will guide you step by step (assumes no prior knowledge)\n* (optionally) guides you through running some examples (feel free to skip those)\n* it will help us collect information about possible errors on different platforms\n\n#### IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS\n\nUsers using Windows are encouraged to install a hypervisor (i.e., a software that allows to creates and run virtual machines): for example, install VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and configure it up to run a virtual Ubuntu Linux inside which to install MONET (using the instructions above).\n\n#### IF YOU ARE A SINGULARITY USER WITHOUT SUDO RIGHTS\n\nSudo rights will be required at installation time for Singularity users: Singularity users will not need sudo rights while running MONET (i.e., Singularity does not require sudo right to run containers), but they will need it at installation time (i.e., at the time the Singularity images are first created). \n\nUsers that don't have sudo rights should follow the regular installation procedure explained above, then refer to MONET/docs/installation_no_sudo.txt where they will find a workaround to complete the installation manually without needing sudo.\n\n## TESTING THE INSTALLATION\n\nAt the end of the install process, you will be asked whether you want to test MONET. This test is completely automatic.\n\n## MONET HELP COMMAND\n\nAfter installing MONET, the help command ```monet --help``` will be available from any location on your system.\n\n## RUNNING\n\nOnce installed, from any location on your system, you can run the following example command: it will run a method called M1 (see section METHODS for details), on a network contained in your /tmp folder (see section INPUT for details), using docker virtualization (see section PREREQUISITES for details). In the remainder of this document, you will find details about what parameters you can use, what to expect as an output and resource usage (in the PARAMETERS, OUTPUT and COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES sections respectively).\n\n```$ monet --help```\n\n```$ monet --input=/tmp/input_network.txt \u2014-method=M1 --container=docker```\n\n## INPUT\n\nThe input file is provided to MONET using the ```--input``` parameter (see section RUNNING and section PARAMETERS).\n\nThe format for the input network is the following: a **tab-separated** file containing one line for each edge. \n\nIf an edge is connecting two nodes, gene_a and gene_b, with a certain weight, the file will contain the line:\n\n```gene_a \\t gene_b \\t weight \\n```\n\nDetails:\n* gene_a and gene_b, the gene ids, can be either *string* or *integer*\n* weight can be of type *integer* or *float*\n* \"\\t\" indicates the tab character and \"\\n\" the newline character\n* no blank spaces should appear, neither as separators nor as part of the gene ids\n\nFor an example, see MONET/.test/system_test/input/zachary_karate_club.txt. The same folder containing the actual inputs to the Disease Module Identification (DMI) DREAM Challenge. Beware that some of the inputs will require high amounts of computational resources and are not suited to be run on a simple laptop or desktop computer; please refer to section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES for details.\n\n## OUTPUT\n\nThe output location is provided to MONET using the ```--output``` parameter (see section OPTIONAL PARAMETERS).\n\nTwo output files will be generated in the directory where you run the command. They are marked with a timestamp, the name of the selected method and the name of your input network. For example, let's assume if you run M1 on 1st January 2020 at midday on a file called input_network.txt:\n* a **console-output** file, which will contain the run-time outputs generated by the method you have selected, providing details about the steps that the M1 algorithm took to generate your output. Any errors would also be redirected here. The file would be called: ```2020-01-01-120000__M1__console-output__input_network.txt```\n* a **result-modules** file, containing the results of your analysis and it will not be generated in case of errors. The file would be called: ```2020-01-01-120000__M1__result-modules__input_network.txt```. It will be in tab-separated format, containing one module per line:\n  * the first value of each line will be a module identifier (in the form of an integer number starting from 1)\n  * the second is a fixed numerical value and can be ignored (curerntly set to ```1.0```, it was originally used in the DREAM Challenge to provide module-level confidence scores)\n  * the rest of the values on the line will be the gene ids container in the input (like gene_a and gene_b, see section INPUT)\n\n## METHODS\n\nThree methods are available as part of MONET, which emerged as the top-performing methods of the DREAM Challenge.\n\nIn order to run one of the three methods, adapt the example command provided in section RUNNING providing the --method option with the name of the chosen method (--method=[K1|M1|R1], for details, see section PARAMETERS).\n\n* **K1**: KERNEL CLUSTERING OPTIMISATION algorithm. K1 is based on the \u201cDiffusion State Distance\u201d (DSD), a novel graph metric which is built on the premise that paths through low-degree nodes are stronger indications of functional similarity than paths that traverse high degree nodes by Cao et al. (2014). The DSD metric is used to define a pairwise distance matrix between all nodes, on which a spectral clustering algorithm is applied. In parallel, dense bipartite sub-graphs are identified using standard graph techniques. Finally, results are merged into a single set of non-overlapping clusters. For further details, please see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7349492/wiki/407359\n* **M1**: MODULARITY OPTIMIZATION algorithm. M1 employs an original technique named Multiresolution introduced by (Arenas et al., 2008) to explore all topological scales at which modules may be found. The novelty of this approach relies on the introduction of a parameter, called resistance, which controls the aversion of nodes to form modules. Modularity (Newman and Girvan, 2004; Arenas et al., 2007) is optimized using an ensemble of algorithms: Extremal optimization (Duch and Arenas, 2005), Spectral optimization (Newman, 2006), Fast algorithm (Newman, 2004), Tabu search (Arenas et al., 2008), and fine-tuning by iterative repositioning of individual nodes in adjacent modules. For further details, please see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7352969/wiki/407384\n* **R1**: RANDOM-WALK-BASED algorithm. R1 is based on a variant of Markov Cluster Algorithm known as balanced Multi-layer Regularized Markov Cluster Algorithm(bMLRMCL) (Satuluriet al., 2010) which scales well to large graphs and minimizes the number of oversized clusters. First, a pre-processing step is applied so that edges with low weights are discarded and all remaining edges are scaled to integer values. Then, bMLRMCL is applied iteratively on modules of size grater than a user-defined threshold.

This might fail on commodity hardware (i.e., a regular laptop or desktop) as about 8GB or RAM need to be available. In that case, you can allocate a larger SWAP partition (on Linux) or run the experiment on more powerful hardware, such as a server. Please browser the rest of the contents of MONET/.test/system_test/reproduce_challenge to view the exact RAM usage (ram_usage.txt) and the challenge outputs produced by MONET (disease_modules_output directory).\n\nTo monitor resource usage when running on your own input (and thus determine the amount or RAM / swap needed by your particular input network for a particular method), two simple scripts have been added to MONET/.test/helper_scripts (for Unix and one for MacOS systems): launch them before execution of MONET and redirect their output to file for simple inspection (no other task should be running).\n\n## BENCHMARKING\n\nFor details about the modularization performance of the MONET methods on a set of artificial benchmarks (Louvain algorithm is shown as a baseline), please refer to the MONET paper in the PUBLICATIONS section; in particular, Fig. 1. MONET/.test/benchmarking for a detailed output of the experiments that have been carried out.\n\n## SOURCE CODE\n\nThe source code is hosted at: https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET.git\n\n## CONTRIBUTING\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to MONET, we encourage you to get in touch! We will be happy to add you to the list of our developers https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET/graphs/contributors. **THANK YOU!**\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - CREATING A BRANCH**\n\nFirst, we will create an issue for the specific feature you are willing to contribute; let's say yours will happen to be issue 999. You will be then asked to create a new git branch where to implement your changes; run the following from the cloned MONET directory: \n\n```$ git checkout -b issues_999```\n\n```$ git push origin issues_999```\n\nAt this point, you are free to make changes to your local code in your laptop. Don't worry if you mess things up, it's no problem to add mistakes to a branch.\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - TESTING YOUR CHANGES**\n\nOnce you are done with your changes, you can test them locally by **reinstalling** from the modified MONET directory.\n\n**CONTRIBUTING - PUBLISHING YOUR CHANGES**\n\nOnce you have tested your changes, run the following from the cloned MONET directory:\n\n```$ git add .```\n\n```$ git commit -m \"adding code for feature # issues_999\"```\n\n```$ git push --set-upstream origin issues_999```\n\n```$ git checkout master```\n\nOne of the MONET developers will test the changes in your branch then merge to Master. \n\n## IMPLEMENTING LOCAL CHANGES TO MONET\n\nIf you wish to implement local changes to MONET, independently from our github repository, you can simply modify the code in your local cloned repository and **reinstall** after having made those changes (i.e. run or re-run the ```install.sh``` script and confirm if you are asked to reinstall). This procedure can be repeated as many times as you like.\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON PROBLEMS\n\nIf a MONET run is suddenly interrupted or if the expected outputs has not been generated, here are few common problems that can occur:\n* lack of RAM: if the console-output file (see section OUTPUT) contains the word \"Killed\", the MONET processed were stopped by the Operating System, likely due to a lack of RAM. To confirm this, please read section COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES to learn how to monitor your resource usage while running MONET.\n* outdated kernel: Singularity users that work on Linux distributions with old kernels (e.g. CentOS 6.1, kernel 2.6) will encounter trouble during the install process; they need to contact their system administrator to inquire whether a kernel upgrade is possible.\n* can't implement local changes: please, refer to section IMPLEMENTING LOCAL CHANGES TO MONET.\n\n## BUG-REPORTS\n\nPlease, address your questions and bug reports to Mattia Tomasoni, <mattia.tomasoni AT unil.ch>. An issue will be opened here to address your problem: https://github.com/BergmannLab/MONET/issues\n\n## PUBLICATIONS\n\n* **MONET paper**: Mattia Tomasoni, Sergio G\u00f3mez, Jake Crawford, Weijia Zhang, Sarvenaz Choobdar, Daniel Marbach and Sven Bergmann.

System requirements\n\nTo setup and run LACHESIS, you will need a computer running in a UNIX environment with at least 16GB of memory, with the following software installed:\n\n- gcc, the C++ compiler ([http://gcc.gnu.org/](http://gcc.gnu.org/))\n- The zlib compression library ([http://www.zlib.net/](http://www.zlib.net/))\n- The boost C++ libraries ([http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/))\n- The SAMtools toolkit for handling SAM/BAM files ([http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)) (make sure to use version 0.1.19 or older)\n\nNote that LACHESIS requires a minimum stack size of 10MB (check with ulimit -s). If your system uses 8MB (e.g. Fedora or Ubuntu), you will need to increase the stack size (ulimit -s 10240). \n\nYou may also need the following software:\n\n- The short-read aligner BWA ([http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)) or another such aligner\n- The BLAST aligner in command-line form ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/))\n- The bedtools toolkit for handling genomic intervals ([https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/](https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/))\n\n#### 2. Downloading the LACHESIS package\n\nDownload the LACHESIS package from [http://shendurelab.github.io/LACHESIS/](http://shendurelab.github.io/LACHESIS/) into a UNIX filesystem.  If you download the tarball (`LACHESIS.tar.gz`), unpack it using the following UNIX commands:\n\n`tar xzvf LACHESIS.tar.gz`  \n`cd LACHESIS/`\n\n#### 3. Compiling the LACHESIS package\n\nTo compile LACHESIS, you must first download and install two other libraries: boost (available at [http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/)) and SAMtools (available at [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)).  Once these are installed, set the shell environment variables `$LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR` and `$LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR` to point to the directories containing these packages.  The command for setting an environment variable will depend on what Unix shell you are using.  For example, in bash, type: `export LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost/` and `export LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR=/path/to/samtools/` (replacing the paths with the paths where you install the libraries.)  (LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR should have the subdirectory `stage/lib/`.)\n\nFinally, to compile LACHESIS, simply type `make` in the main LACHESIS directory.\n\n#### 4. Testing out LACHESIS on a sample dataset\n\nThis LACHESIS distribution includes a small sample dataset - specifically, a reduced version of the hESC dataset we used in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2727) - that allows you to try out running LACHESIS.  To run it, go into the LACHESIS directory and type `Lachesis INIs/test_case.ini`.  The file `test_case.ini` gives the parameters that control how LACHESIS is run, in this case including the input files from the sample dataset.  On my computer, LACHESIS takes 3 minutes to run on this dataset, most of which is in file I/O.\n\nA directory called `out/test_case/` will be created and will contain the results from this run.  A summary of the results is in the file `REPORT.txt`; the main output files are in the subdirectory `main_results/`; other intermediate results are in the subdirectory `cached_data/`.  The results from this test case won't be very good because the dataset of Hi-C links is so small, but they should give you an idea of how to run LACHESIS and what to expect from it.\n\n## Running Lachesis\n\n#### 1. Input requirements\n\nSo you want to use LACHESIS to scaffold your _de novo_ assembly.  You must start with two (or three) input files:\n\n- Your Hi-C reads, in an alignable format\n- Your draft _de novo_ assembly, in fasta format\n- (Optional) A reference assembly, in fasta format\n\nIf you are going to use BWA to align your Hi-C reads, then the reads must be in a set of fastq or BAM files, and there should be two files for each library: one for the first read in each pair, and one for the second.  If you are using another aligner, you may have your Hi-C reads in another format as required by that aligner.\n\nObviously you can't supply a reference assembly if no such assembly exists yet.  But if there is one, the reference assembly can be input to LACHESIS in order to provide some very useful reference-based evaluation of the result.  Even a partial sequence assembly or an assembly of a related species can be helpful.  However, note that Lachesis is not an ideal piece of software for performing assisted assembly - that is, a semi-_de novo_ assembly process that relies on the assumption of synteny with an existing reference genome.  For more information on assisted assembly, see [Gnerre et al, 2009](http://genomebiology.com/content/10/8/R88).\n\n#### 2. Creating an INI file\n\nBefore running LACHESIS, you will need to create an initialization file, or INI file (`*.ini`).  LACHESIS will parse this file and determine everything it needs to know in order to run, including the locations of all other input files.  To create an INI file, make a copy of any of the INI files in the subdirectory `INIs/` and edit that copy.  The INI file contains several parameters; you will want to read through its documentation and set all parameters as you see fit.\n\nFive of the INI parameters describe files that LACHESIS uses: `DRAFT_ASSEMBLY_FASTA`, `SAM_FILES` (in `SAM_DIR`), `RE_SITE_SEQ`, `BLAST_FILE_HEAD`, and `REF_ASSEMBLY_FASTA`.  These all refer to files that you will need to create before running LACHESIS, by processing your input datasets.  See the included file `Data Prep Flowchart.png` for a visual guide to this process.\n\nMany of the other INI parameters provide heuristic parameters.  It's worth your time to examine these parameters to get a better idea of what LACHESIS is doing.  But if you're unsure of any of them, feel free to use the values in `INIs/test_case.ini` as defaults.\n\n#### 3. Aligning the Hi-C reads to the draft assembly\n\nLACHESIS scaffolds _de novo_ assemblies using the locations of the Hi-C reads on the assembly contigs/scaffolds.  Hence you must align the Hi-C reads to the assembly contigs/scaffolds.  You must ultimately produce files containing paired-read alignments in the SAM/BAM format (either SAMs or BAMs are acceptable; see [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)).  For each library of Hi-C reads (represented by a pair of fastq files) you should create a single SAM/BAM file describing the read pairs.  DO NOT create a pair of SAM/BAM files, one for each read in the pair!\n\nAligning is a computationally intensive process and will take far more CPU time than LACHESIS itself will.  You can use any aligner that produces SAM or BAM files, but we recommend BWA ([http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)), which we used during the development of LACHESIS.  If you use BWA, you will need to have your Hi-C reads in fastq format as described above, and you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n- Use `bwa index` to index your draft assembly.  If your genome is large (>10 Mb), you will need to use the flag `-a bwtsw`.  This will create a file `<assembly>.fasta.bwt`.\n- Use `bwa aln` to align the Hi-C reads to the indexed assembly.  Each individual fastq file is aligned separately.\n- Use `bwa sampe` to determine the optimal placement of each read pair.  This is where the two fastq files from each library are combined.  The output of `bwa sampe` will be a SAM file (`*.sam`).  You can compress this file to a BAM file (`*.bam`) using samtools (`samtools view -bS <sam-file>`) which will use less disk space and less I/O time.\n\n#### 4. Filtering the Hi-C reads\n\nMany of the Hi-C reads can be determined to be noise, rather than signal.  It is not strictly necessary to remove these reads from your BAM files before running LACHESIS.  But it will reduce the files' size, reduce the I/O time required by LACHESIS to read them in, and may reduce LACHESIS' error rate.\n\nWe have included the scripts `PreprocessSAMs.pl` and `PreprocessSAMs.sh`, which perform the filtering methods we used.  `PreprocessSAMs.pl` removes all reads that do not map within 500bp of a restriction enzyme site, following the suggestion of [Yaffe & Tanay (Nature Genetics, 2011)](dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.947).  To do this, it uses the script `make_BED_around_RE_site.pl` (also included) and also the bedtools library.  `PreprocessSAMs.pl` also removes unpaired reads, which LACHESIS cannot use.  Make sure to set the variable `$RE_site` in `PreprocessSAMs.pl`.  You can also use the script `PreprocessSAMs.sh` as a batch script to run `PreprocessSAMs.pl` on a set of SAM/BAM files (set the variables `SAMs` and `ASSEMBLY`).  The final set of SAM/BAM files is specified in the INI file as the parameter `SAM_FILES`, which names the files, and `SAM_DIR`, which names the directory they are in.\n\n#### 5. Aligning the draft assembly to the reference assembly, if there is one\n\n**You can skip this step if you aren't using a reference assembly**.  LACHESIS needs to know where the contigs/scaffolds from the draft assembly belong on the reference chromosomes.  It can process the text output from the blastn command-line program, which you can read about and download at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/).  You will need to perform the following steps:\n\n- Create a BLAST database for the reference assembly: `makeblastdb -in <ref-fasta> -dbtype=nucl -out <ref-fasta>.blastdb`\n- Run blastn.  Make sure you use the argument 'outfmt -7' so that blastn produces output in the format that LACHESIS expects.\n- If you have a large (mammalian-scale) draft assembly, blastn will take a long time to align it.  You may want to split it up into separate fasta files and run blastn on each file separately.  To see how we did this on the human assembly, see the included scripts blast.sh and blast.qsub.sh and the output files in `test_case/draft_assembly/`.  The blastn output files from each chunk should be named `<BLAST_FILE_HEAD>.NNN.blast.out`, where NNN = 1, 2, 3, ...\n- The blastn output file(s) are specified in the INI file by the parameter `BLAST_FILE_HEAD`.  Note that LACHESIS parses the BLAST output the first time it runs, then creates a cached file so that it doesn't have to take the time to parse the BLAST output again.  This means that if you change the set of BLAST files, you'll need to delete the file at `<OUTPUT_DIR>/cached_data/TrueMapping.assembly.txt` in order to get LACHESIS to load your new set of BLAST files.\n\n#### 6. Running LACHESIS\n\nIf you've done steps 2-5 above, and you've created an INI file with the appropriate input file names, you should be good to go.  Try running LACHESIS with the command: `Lachesis <your-INI-file>`.  If there are any problems with the INI file, including missing input files, LACHESIS will immediately abort and will explain what went wrong.  If not, then LACHESIS will begin loading in files, and all you need to do is wait and see what it does.\n\nThere are many parameters in the INI file beyond the inputs to LACHESIS.  You may need to tweak some of these parameters in order to get an optimal assembly.  Be sure to read the documentation in the INI file carefully so that you know what you're doing.\n\n#### 7. Interpreting the LACHESIS results\n\nLACHESIS will create a set of output files in the directory `OUTPUT_DIR` that you have specified in the INI file.  This directory contains a file `REPORT.txt` that will give a topline summary of LACHESIS' performance.  It also contains two subdirectories, `main_results/` and `cached_data/`.  The `main_results/` directory will contain the following files:\n\n1. `clusters.txt` and `clusters.by_name.txt`:  These files indicate the clustering results.  Each of LACHESIS' chromosome group is shown as a line, and the input contigs/scaffolds in that group are listed on the line, either by ID (`clusters.txt`) or by contig name (`clusters.by_name.txt`).\n2. `group*.ordering`: These files indicate the ordering and orienting results.  There is one file for each group.  In each file is a list of input contigs/scaffolds in order, with their orientations, orientation quality scores, and gap sizes.\n\nTo create the final assembly fasta, run the included script `CreateScaffoldedFasta.pl`.  After you have run this, `OUTPUT_DIR` will contain the file `Lachesis_assembly.fasta`.  This fasta file will contain your output assembly, in three sections of successive contigs:\n\n1. One large scaffold for each of the ordered and oriented chromosome groups predicted by LACHESIS (i.e., each of the `group*.ordering` files.)\n2. All of the input contigs/scaffolds that have been clustered into a chromosome group by LACHESIS, but were not ordered within that group.  They will be given names indicating what chromosome group they belong in.\n3. All of the input contigs/scaffolds that were not clustered at all by LACHESIS.\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nLACHESIS is a good piece of software, but it isn't perfect.  You may run it and get a result you weren't expecting.  You may also run it and get no result at all because it crashes.\n\n#### 1. LACHESIS won't compile!\n\nThere are several reasons why LACHESIS may fail to compile.  Some of the most common problems involve linking in the samtools and boost dependencies so that the LACHESIS source code can find them.  You will need to set the environment variables LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR and LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR, and you should make sure you're using an older version of samtools (0.1.19 or earlier).  For more details, see \"Compiling the LACHESIS package\", above.\n\n#### 2. LACHESIS is crashing!\n\nIf LACHESIS crashes, the first thing you should do is look carefully at its output.  It might give a verbose explanation of what went wrong and give you a good idea for how to fix it.  You may also receive an \"assertion error\", which looks like this: `Assertion ... failed.`  That means that at some stage of the algorithm, LACHESIS encountered something specific that it wasn't expecting.  An assertion error will come with a reference to the file (`*.cc` or `*.h`) and the line number where the error occurred.  Try looking at that line in the file, which should contain the function `assert()`.  There should be some comments around that line that explain what might be causing the assertion error.\n\nIf you run LACHESIS on the provided test case and a segmentation fault occurs, you're running into a known problem: a limitation in stack size (a low-level operating system attribute.)  Some OS's (including Fedora and Ubuntu) set a default stack size of 8 MB, but LACHESIS needs 10 MB.  To fix this, type: `ulimit -s 10240`\n\nIn general, we've made a strong effort to make LACHESIS a well-designed and well-commented piece of code.  If you're familiar with C++, you should be able to poke around in the source code and get an idea of what's going on.  We recommend starting with the top-level module, `Lachesis.cc`, and working from there.\n\nIf all else fails, and you still need help running LACHESIS, please e-mail Josh Burton at `jnburton at uw.edu`.\n\n#### 3. LACHESIS is producing a weird result!\n\nAfter you've gotten LACHESIS to run properly, take a good look at the REPORT.txt file.  If you're getting a weird result - for example, very little sequence is being assembled, or the error rate is high - you may need to tune LACHESIS' performance.\n\nThere are several heuristic parameters involved in the running of LACHESIS.  They include: `CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES`, `CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY`, `CLUSTER_DO_NONINFORMATIVE`, `ORDER_MIN_N_RES_IN_TRUNK`, and `ORDER_MIN_N_RES_IN_SHREDS`.  These parameters are tuning knobs that can be tweaked as necessary to produce a high-quality draft assembly.  For the LACHESIS publication, these parameters were set to values that are appropriate for the datasets that went into those assemblies, and these are the values you can see in the INI files that are provided with the LACHESIS distribution.  However, these values may not work for your situation.  The ideal values depend on the repeat content of the genome, the N50 of your input assembly, your density of Hi-C data, and your preference for accuracy versus completeness.\n\nTry tweaking some of the parameters and re-running LACHESIS.  The easiest approach is to produce a good clustering result first, then go from there to ordering (and make sure to set `OVERWRITE_CLMS = 1` when you move from clustering to ordering.)  If you have a reference genome to compare your result against (`USE_REFERENCE = `), the reference-based evaluation will be very helpful.\n\n## COPYRIGHT AND DISCLAIMER\n\nThe LACHESIS software package and all software and documentation contained with it are copyright \u00a9 2012-2013 by Josh Burton and the University of Washington.

System requirements\n\nTo setup and run LACHESIS, you will need a computer running in a UNIX environment with at least 16GB of memory, with the following software installed:\n\n- gcc, the C++ compiler ([http://gcc.gnu.org/](http://gcc.gnu.org/))\n- The zlib compression library ([http://www.zlib.net/](http://www.zlib.net/))\n- The boost C++ libraries ([http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/))\n- The SAMtools toolkit for handling SAM/BAM files ([http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)) (make sure to use version 0.1.19 or older)\n\nNote that LACHESIS requires a minimum stack size of 10MB (check with ulimit -s). If your system uses 8MB (e.g. Fedora or Ubuntu), you will need to increase the stack size (ulimit -s 10240). \n\nYou may also need the following software:\n\n- The short-read aligner BWA ([http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)) or another such aligner\n- The BLAST aligner in command-line form ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/))\n- The bedtools toolkit for handling genomic intervals ([https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/](https://code.google.com/p/bedtools/))\n\n#### 2. Downloading the LACHESIS package\n\nDownload the LACHESIS package from [http://shendurelab.github.io/LACHESIS/](http://shendurelab.github.io/LACHESIS/) into a UNIX filesystem.  If you download the tarball (`LACHESIS.tar.gz`), unpack it using the following UNIX commands:\n\n`tar xzvf LACHESIS.tar.gz`  \n`cd LACHESIS/`\n\n#### 3. Compiling the LACHESIS package\n\nTo compile LACHESIS, you must first download and install two other libraries: boost (available at [http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/)) and SAMtools (available at [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)).  Once these are installed, set the shell environment variables `$LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR` and `$LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR` to point to the directories containing these packages.  The command for setting an environment variable will depend on what Unix shell you are using.  For example, in bash, type: `export LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost/` and `export LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR=/path/to/samtools/` (replacing the paths with the paths where you install the libraries.)  (LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR should have the subdirectory `stage/lib/`.)\n\nFinally, to compile LACHESIS, simply type `make` in the main LACHESIS directory.\n\n#### 4. Testing out LACHESIS on a sample dataset\n\nThis LACHESIS distribution includes a small sample dataset - specifically, a reduced version of the hESC dataset we used in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2727) - that allows you to try out running LACHESIS.  To run it, go into the LACHESIS directory and type `Lachesis INIs/test_case.ini`.  The file `test_case.ini` gives the parameters that control how LACHESIS is run, in this case including the input files from the sample dataset.  On my computer, LACHESIS takes 3 minutes to run on this dataset, most of which is in file I/O.\n\nA directory called `out/test_case/` will be created and will contain the results from this run.  A summary of the results is in the file `REPORT.txt`; the main output files are in the subdirectory `main_results/`; other intermediate results are in the subdirectory `cached_data/`.  The results from this test case won't be very good because the dataset of Hi-C links is so small, but they should give you an idea of how to run LACHESIS and what to expect from it.\n\n## Running Lachesis\n\n#### 1. Input requirements\n\nSo you want to use LACHESIS to scaffold your _de novo_ assembly.  You must start with two (or three) input files:\n\n- Your Hi-C reads, in an alignable format\n- Your draft _de novo_ assembly, in fasta format\n- (Optional) A reference assembly, in fasta format\n\nIf you are going to use BWA to align your Hi-C reads, then the reads must be in a set of fastq or BAM files, and there should be two files for each library: one for the first read in each pair, and one for the second.  If you are using another aligner, you may have your Hi-C reads in another format as required by that aligner.\n\nObviously you can't supply a reference assembly if no such assembly exists yet.  But if there is one, the reference assembly can be input to LACHESIS in order to provide some very useful reference-based evaluation of the result.  Even a partial sequence assembly or an assembly of a related species can be helpful.  However, note that Lachesis is not an ideal piece of software for performing assisted assembly - that is, a semi-_de novo_ assembly process that relies on the assumption of synteny with an existing reference genome.  For more information on assisted assembly, see [Gnerre et al, 2009](http://genomebiology.com/content/10/8/R88).\n\n#### 2. Creating an INI file\n\nBefore running LACHESIS, you will need to create an initialization file, or INI file (`*.ini`).  LACHESIS will parse this file and determine everything it needs to know in order to run, including the locations of all other input files.  To create an INI file, make a copy of any of the INI files in the subdirectory `INIs/` and edit that copy.  The INI file contains several parameters; you will want to read through its documentation and set all parameters as you see fit.\n\nFive of the INI parameters describe files that LACHESIS uses: `DRAFT_ASSEMBLY_FASTA`, `SAM_FILES` (in `SAM_DIR`), `RE_SITE_SEQ`, `BLAST_FILE_HEAD`, and `REF_ASSEMBLY_FASTA`.  These all refer to files that you will need to create before running LACHESIS, by processing your input datasets.  See the included file `Data Prep Flowchart.png` for a visual guide to this process.\n\nMany of the other INI parameters provide heuristic parameters.  It's worth your time to examine these parameters to get a better idea of what LACHESIS is doing.  But if you're unsure of any of them, feel free to use the values in `INIs/test_case.ini` as defaults.\n\n#### 3. Aligning the Hi-C reads to the draft assembly\n\nLACHESIS scaffolds _de novo_ assemblies using the locations of the Hi-C reads on the assembly contigs/scaffolds.  Hence you must align the Hi-C reads to the assembly contigs/scaffolds.  You must ultimately produce files containing paired-read alignments in the SAM/BAM format (either SAMs or BAMs are acceptable; see [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)).  For each library of Hi-C reads (represented by a pair of fastq files) you should create a single SAM/BAM file describing the read pairs.  DO NOT create a pair of SAM/BAM files, one for each read in the pair!\n\nAligning is a computationally intensive process and will take far more CPU time than LACHESIS itself will.  You can use any aligner that produces SAM or BAM files, but we recommend BWA ([http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)), which we used during the development of LACHESIS.  If you use BWA, you will need to have your Hi-C reads in fastq format as described above, and you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n- Use `bwa index` to index your draft assembly.  If your genome is large (>10 Mb), you will need to use the flag `-a bwtsw`.  This will create a file `<assembly>.fasta.bwt`.\n- Use `bwa aln` to align the Hi-C reads to the indexed assembly.  Each individual fastq file is aligned separately.\n- Use `bwa sampe` to determine the optimal placement of each read pair.  This is where the two fastq files from each library are combined.  The output of `bwa sampe` will be a SAM file (`*.sam`).  You can compress this file to a BAM file (`*.bam`) using samtools (`samtools view -bS <sam-file>`) which will use less disk space and less I/O time.\n\n#### 4. Filtering the Hi-C reads\n\nMany of the Hi-C reads can be determined to be noise, rather than signal.  It is not strictly necessary to remove these reads from your BAM files before running LACHESIS.  But it will reduce the files' size, reduce the I/O time required by LACHESIS to read them in, and may reduce LACHESIS' error rate.\n\nWe have included the scripts `PreprocessSAMs.pl` and `PreprocessSAMs.sh`, which perform the filtering methods we used.  `PreprocessSAMs.pl` removes all reads that do not map within 500bp of a restriction enzyme site, following the suggestion of [Yaffe & Tanay (Nature Genetics, 2011)](dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.947).  To do this, it uses the script `make_BED_around_RE_site.pl` (also included) and also the bedtools library.  `PreprocessSAMs.pl` also removes unpaired reads, which LACHESIS cannot use.  Make sure to set the variable `$RE_site` in `PreprocessSAMs.pl`.  You can also use the script `PreprocessSAMs.sh` as a batch script to run `PreprocessSAMs.pl` on a set of SAM/BAM files (set the variables `SAMs` and `ASSEMBLY`).  The final set of SAM/BAM files is specified in the INI file as the parameter `SAM_FILES`, which names the files, and `SAM_DIR`, which names the directory they are in.\n\n#### 5. Aligning the draft assembly to the reference assembly, if there is one\n\n**You can skip this step if you aren't using a reference assembly**.  LACHESIS needs to know where the contigs/scaffolds from the draft assembly belong on the reference chromosomes.  It can process the text output from the blastn command-line program, which you can read about and download at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/).  You will need to perform the following steps:\n\n- Create a BLAST database for the reference assembly: `makeblastdb -in <ref-fasta> -dbtype=nucl -out <ref-fasta>.blastdb`\n- Run blastn.  Make sure you use the argument 'outfmt -7' so that blastn produces output in the format that LACHESIS expects.\n- If you have a large (mammalian-scale) draft assembly, blastn will take a long time to align it.  You may want to split it up into separate fasta files and run blastn on each file separately.  To see how we did this on the human assembly, see the included scripts blast.sh and blast.qsub.sh and the output files in `test_case/draft_assembly/`.  The blastn output files from each chunk should be named `<BLAST_FILE_HEAD>.NNN.blast.out`, where NNN = 1, 2, 3, ...\n- The blastn output file(s) are specified in the INI file by the parameter `BLAST_FILE_HEAD`.  Note that LACHESIS parses the BLAST output the first time it runs, then creates a cached file so that it doesn't have to take the time to parse the BLAST output again.  This means that if you change the set of BLAST files, you'll need to delete the file at `<OUTPUT_DIR>/cached_data/TrueMapping.assembly.txt` in order to get LACHESIS to load your new set of BLAST files.\n\n#### 6. Running LACHESIS\n\nIf you've done steps 2-5 above, and you've created an INI file with the appropriate input file names, you should be good to go.  Try running LACHESIS with the command: `Lachesis <your-INI-file>`.  If there are any problems with the INI file, including missing input files, LACHESIS will immediately abort and will explain what went wrong.  If not, then LACHESIS will begin loading in files, and all you need to do is wait and see what it does.\n\nThere are many parameters in the INI file beyond the inputs to LACHESIS.  You may need to tweak some of these parameters in order to get an optimal assembly.  Be sure to read the documentation in the INI file carefully so that you know what you're doing.\n\n#### 7. Interpreting the LACHESIS results\n\nLACHESIS will create a set of output files in the directory `OUTPUT_DIR` that you have specified in the INI file.  This directory contains a file `REPORT.txt` that will give a topline summary of LACHESIS' performance.  It also contains two subdirectories, `main_results/` and `cached_data/`.  The `main_results/` directory will contain the following files:\n\n1. `clusters.txt` and `clusters.by_name.txt`:  These files indicate the clustering results.  Each of LACHESIS' chromosome group is shown as a line, and the input contigs/scaffolds in that group are listed on the line, either by ID (`clusters.txt`) or by contig name (`clusters.by_name.txt`).\n2. `group*.ordering`: These files indicate the ordering and orienting results.  There is one file for each group.  In each file is a list of input contigs/scaffolds in order, with their orientations, orientation quality scores, and gap sizes.\n\nTo create the final assembly fasta, run the included script `CreateScaffoldedFasta.pl`.  After you have run this, `OUTPUT_DIR` will contain the file `Lachesis_assembly.fasta`.  This fasta file will contain your output assembly, in three sections of successive contigs:\n\n1. One large scaffold for each of the ordered and oriented chromosome groups predicted by LACHESIS (i.e., each of the `group*.ordering` files.)\n2. All of the input contigs/scaffolds that have been clustered into a chromosome group by LACHESIS, but were not ordered within that group.  They will be given names indicating what chromosome group they belong in.\n3. All of the input contigs/scaffolds that were not clustered at all by LACHESIS.\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nLACHESIS is a good piece of software, but it isn't perfect.  You may run it and get a result you weren't expecting.  You may also run it and get no result at all because it crashes.\n\n#### 1. LACHESIS won't compile!\n\nThere are several reasons why LACHESIS may fail to compile.  Some of the most common problems involve linking in the samtools and boost dependencies so that the LACHESIS source code can find them.  You will need to set the environment variables LACHESIS_BOOST_DIR and LACHESIS_SAMTOOLS_DIR, and you should make sure you're using an older version of samtools (0.1.19 or earlier).  For more details, see \"Compiling the LACHESIS package\", above.\n\n#### 2. LACHESIS is crashing!\n\nIf LACHESIS crashes, the first thing you should do is look carefully at its output.  It might give a verbose explanation of what went wrong and give you a good idea for how to fix it.  You may also receive an \"assertion error\", which looks like this: `Assertion ... failed.`  That means that at some stage of the algorithm, LACHESIS encountered something specific that it wasn't expecting.  An assertion error will come with a reference to the file (`*.cc` or `*.h`) and the line number where the error occurred.  Try looking at that line in the file, which should contain the function `assert()`.  There should be some comments around that line that explain what might be causing the assertion error.\n\nIf you run LACHESIS on the provided test case and a segmentation fault occurs, you're running into a known problem: a limitation in stack size (a low-level operating system attribute.)  Some OS's (including Fedora and Ubuntu) set a default stack size of 8 MB, but LACHESIS needs 10 MB.  To fix this, type: `ulimit -s 10240`\n\nIn general, we've made a strong effort to make LACHESIS a well-designed and well-commented piece of code.  If you're familiar with C++, you should be able to poke around in the source code and get an idea of what's going on.  We recommend starting with the top-level module, `Lachesis.cc`, and working from there.\n\nIf all else fails, and you still need help running LACHESIS, please e-mail Josh Burton at `jnburton at uw.edu`.\n\n#### 3. LACHESIS is producing a weird result!\n\nAfter you've gotten LACHESIS to run properly, take a good look at the REPORT.txt file.  If you're getting a weird result - for example, very little sequence is being assembled, or the error rate is high - you may need to tune LACHESIS' performance.\n\nThere are several heuristic parameters involved in the running of LACHESIS.  They include: `CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES`, `CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY`, `CLUSTER_DO_NONINFORMATIVE`, `ORDER_MIN_N_RES_IN_TRUNK`, and `ORDER_MIN_N_RES_IN_SHREDS`.  These parameters are tuning knobs that can be tweaked as necessary to produce a high-quality draft assembly.  For the LACHESIS publication, these parameters were set to values that are appropriate for the datasets that went into those assemblies, and these are the values you can see in the INI files that are provided with the LACHESIS distribution.  However, these values may not work for your situation.  The ideal values depend on the repeat content of the genome, the N50 of your input assembly, your density of Hi-C data, and your preference for accuracy versus completeness.\n\nTry tweaking some of the parameters and re-running LACHESIS.  The easiest approach is to produce a good clustering result first, then go from there to ordering (and make sure to set `OVERWRITE_CLMS = 1` when you move from clustering to ordering.)  If you have a reference genome to compare your result against (`USE_REFERENCE = `), the reference-based evaluation will be very helpful.\n\n## COPYRIGHT AND DISCLAIMER\n\nThe LACHESIS software package and all software and documentation contained with it are copyright \u00a9 2012-2013 by Josh Burton and the University of Washington.

Introduces a `PhaseRegion` NamedTuple that describes the data to calculate for each phase boundary set, instead of passing around all the data lists disparately. \r\n    * This significantly reduces the complexity of the driving force calculation. \r\n    * The `PhaseRegion` gets its own PhaseRecords for the calculation and contains all the relevant equilibrium arguments for that specific data. This therefore fixes a bug for mixing data types across different systems, e.g. fitting a ternary database with binary data, which used to fail because the callables/PhaseRecords would be built for the ternary, but there were only composition information for the binary and the PhaseRecords were not re-computed each time. For this reason, https://github.com/pycalphad/pycalphad/pull/264 is required to run ESPEI in parallel, since SymEngine Lambda compiled objects cannot be pickled.\r\n    * PhaseRecords are now updated for each parameter set that is calculated. This is an optimization that prevents recalculating the constraints and recompiling the constraints every time equilibrium is called, since each tieline point in the PhaseRegion will always have the same conditions and therefore constraints.\r\n2. \"Shadow functions\" are implemented that shadow pycalphad's `calculate` (`calculate_`) and `equilibrium` (`equilibrium_`). These are optimized versions of pycalphad's functions that operate directly on the species, phase records, and other pycalphad internal objects as much as possible to optimize calls.\r\n3. A `no_op_equilibrium_` \"shadow function\" (it doesn't really shadow anything, but exists in the same vein) which doesn't actually call `solve_eq_at_conditions` and instead just treats the `starting_point` solution as the equilibrium solution. This can give large speedups (I have already seen 3x-10x for ZPF data in certain tests systems)\r\n4.

Run genome simulation with model defined by prior distributions of parameters and demographic model structure.\n2. Take into account SNP array ascertainment bias by creating pseudo array based on priors of number of samples of discovery populations and allele frequency cut-off.\n3. Calculate genomic summary statistics on simulated genomes and pseudo arrays. \n\nThis is ideal for use with Approximate Bayesian Computation on whole genome or SNP array data.\n\nUses c++ programs macs and GERMLINE. For more information on these programs, see:  \nhttps://github.com/gchen98/macs  \nhttps://github.com/sgusev/GERMLINE  \n\n## Install\n\ncd to the directory you want to work in,\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/agladstein/SimPrily.git\n```\n\n#### Environment Set up\nIf using Vagrant (this is recommended if running on non-Linux OS):\n\nStart Vagrant, ssh into Vagrant, cd to SimPrily directory:\n```bash\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh\ncd /vagrant\n``` \nInstall the virtual environment and install the requirements.\n```bash\n./setup/setup_env_vbox_2.7.sh\n```\n\nIf not using Vagrant, just install the virtual environment and install the requirements:\n```bash\n./setup/setup_env_2.7.sh\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\ne.g. One Test simulation:  \n```\npython simprily.py -p examples/eg1/param_file_eg1_asc.txt -m examples/eg1/model_file_eg1_asc.csv -g genetic_map_b37/genetic_map_GRCh37_chr1.txt.macshs -a array_template/ill_650_test.bed -i 1 -o output_dir -v\n```\n\nFor quick help:\n```\npython simprily.py --help\n```\n\n#### Input  \n`simprily.py` takes 4 required arguments and 2 optional arguments, and help, verbose, and profile options.   \n\nRun as  \n```\npython simprily.py [-h] -p PARAM -m MODEL -i ID -o OUT [-g MAP] [-a ARRAY] [-v] [--profile]\n```\n##### Required \n`-p PARAM` or `--param PARAM` = The location of the parameter file  \n`-m MODEL` or `--model MODEL` = The location of the model file  \n`-i ID` or `--id ID` = The unique identifier of the job  \n`-o OUT` or `--out OUT` = The location of the output directory  \n \n##### Optional\n`-h` or `--help` = shows a help message and exists  \n`-v` = increase output verbosity. This includes 3 levels, `-v`, `-vv`, and `-vvv`  \n`--profile` = Print a log file containing the time in seconds and memory use in Mb for main functions  \n`-g MAP` or `--map MAP` = The location of the genetic map file  \n`-a ARRAY` or `--array ARRAY` = The location of the array template file, in bed form  \n\n#### Output\nThree subdirectories are created in the directory specified in the `output_dir` argument.  \n```\noutput_dir/results\noutput_dir/sim_data\noutput_dir/germline_out\n```\n\n##### Intermediate files\nIntermediate files go to `output_dir/sim_data` and `output_dir/germline_out`.    \n`output_dir/sim_data` contains PLINK formated .ped and .map files created from the pseudo array, which are necessary to run GERMLINE.  \n`output_dir/germline_out` contains the GERMLINE .match output and .log. The .match contains all of the identified IBD segments.  \nThese files are NOT automatically removed in python script, but are unnecessary once the job is complete.  \n\n##### Results files\nOutput files go to `output_dir/results`.  \n`output_dir/results` contains the parameter values used in the simulation and the summary statistics calculated from the simulation.  \nThe first line is a header with the parameter names and summary statistics names.\nThe second line is the parameter values and summary statistics values.  \n\n-------------------------\n\n## Open Science Grid\nMust have an Open Science Grid Connect account.  \nCreate an account at https://osgconnect.net/signup\n\nLog onto Open Science Grid Connect\n```\nssh user-name@login01.osgconnect.net\n```\n\nWorking directory must be `pegasus_workflow`.\n\nSubmit a Pegasus workflow (must be in `pegasus_workflow`)\n```bash\n./submit -p PARAM -m MODEL -j NUM [-g MAP] [-a ARRAY]\n```\n\ne.g.  \n```bash\n./submit -p ../examples/eg2/param_file_eg2_asc.txt -m ../examples/eg2/model_file_eg2_asc.csv -j 10 -a ../array_template/ill_650_test.bed -g ../genetic_map_b37/genetic_map_GRCh37_chr1.txt.macshs\n``` \n\nThe results will appear in \n```\n/local-scratch/user-name/workflows/simprily_id\n```\nwhere `user-name` is specific to the user, and `id` is the workflow id.\n\n-------------------------\n\n## Links\n\n* [Main SimPrily GitHub Repository](https://agladstein.github.io/SimPrily/)\n  * [SimPrily Read the Docs](http://simprily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n  * [SimPrily Code](https://github.com/agladstein/SimPrily)\n* [CyVerse Discovery Environment SimPrily Workflow]()\n  1.

Run genome simulation with model defined by prior distributions of parameters and demographic model structure.\n2. Take into account SNP array ascertainment bias by creating pseudo array based on priors of number of samples of discovery populations and allele frequency cut-off.\n3. Calculate genomic summary statistics on simulated genomes and pseudo arrays. \n\nThis is ideal for use with Approximate Bayesian Computation on whole genome or SNP array data.\n\nUses c++ programs macs and GERMLINE. For more information on these programs, see:  \nhttps://github.com/gchen98/macs  \nhttps://github.com/sgusev/GERMLINE  \n\n## Install\n\ncd to the directory you want to work in,\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/agladstein/SimPrily.git\n```\n\n#### Environment Set up\nIf using Vagrant (this is recommended if running on non-Linux OS):\n\nStart Vagrant, ssh into Vagrant, cd to SimPrily directory:\n```bash\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh\ncd /vagrant\n``` \nInstall the virtual environment and install the requirements.\n```bash\n./setup/setup_env_vbox_2.7.sh\n```\n\nIf not using Vagrant, just install the virtual environment and install the requirements:\n```bash\n./setup/setup_env_2.7.sh\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\ne.g. One Test simulation:  \n```\npython simprily.py -p examples/eg1/param_file_eg1_asc.txt -m examples/eg1/model_file_eg1_asc.csv -g genetic_map_b37/genetic_map_GRCh37_chr1.txt.macshs -a array_template/ill_650_test.bed -i 1 -o output_dir -v\n```\n\nFor quick help:\n```\npython simprily.py --help\n```\n\n#### Input  \n`simprily.py` takes 4 required arguments and 2 optional arguments, and help, verbose, and profile options.   \n\nRun as  \n```\npython simprily.py [-h] -p PARAM -m MODEL -i ID -o OUT [-g MAP] [-a ARRAY] [-v] [--profile]\n```\n##### Required \n`-p PARAM` or `--param PARAM` = The location of the parameter file  \n`-m MODEL` or `--model MODEL` = The location of the model file  \n`-i ID` or `--id ID` = The unique identifier of the job  \n`-o OUT` or `--out OUT` = The location of the output directory  \n \n##### Optional\n`-h` or `--help` = shows a help message and exists  \n`-v` = increase output verbosity. This includes 3 levels, `-v`, `-vv`, and `-vvv`  \n`--profile` = Print a log file containing the time in seconds and memory use in Mb for main functions  \n`-g MAP` or `--map MAP` = The location of the genetic map file  \n`-a ARRAY` or `--array ARRAY` = The location of the array template file, in bed form  \n\n#### Output\nThree subdirectories are created in the directory specified in the `output_dir` argument.  \n```\noutput_dir/results\noutput_dir/sim_data\noutput_dir/germline_out\n```\n\n##### Intermediate files\nIntermediate files go to `output_dir/sim_data` and `output_dir/germline_out`.    \n`output_dir/sim_data` contains PLINK formated .ped and .map files created from the pseudo array, which are necessary to run GERMLINE.  \n`output_dir/germline_out` contains the GERMLINE .match output and .log. The .match contains all of the identified IBD segments.  \nThese files are NOT automatically removed in python script, but are unnecessary once the job is complete.  \n\n##### Results files\nOutput files go to `output_dir/results`.  \n`output_dir/results` contains the parameter values used in the simulation and the summary statistics calculated from the simulation.  \nThe first line is a header with the parameter names and summary statistics names.\nThe second line is the parameter values and summary statistics values.  \n\n-------------------------\n\n## Open Science Grid\nMust have an Open Science Grid Connect account.  \nCreate an account at https://osgconnect.net/signup\n\nLog onto Open Science Grid Connect\n```\nssh user-name@login01.osgconnect.net\n```\n\nWorking directory must be `pegasus_workflow`.\n\nSubmit a Pegasus workflow (must be in `pegasus_workflow`)\n```bash\n./submit -p PARAM -m MODEL -j NUM [-g MAP] [-a ARRAY]\n```\n\ne.g.  \n```bash\n./submit -p ../examples/eg2/param_file_eg2_asc.txt -m ../examples/eg2/model_file_eg2_asc.csv -j 10 -a ../array_template/ill_650_test.bed -g ../genetic_map_b37/genetic_map_GRCh37_chr1.txt.macshs\n``` \n\nThe results will appear in \n```\n/local-scratch/user-name/workflows/simprily_id\n```\nwhere `user-name` is specific to the user, and `id` is the workflow id.\n\n-------------------------\n\n## Links\n\n* [Main SimPrily GitHub Repository](https://agladstein.github.io/SimPrily/)\n  * [SimPrily Read the Docs](http://simprily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n  * [SimPrily Code](https://github.com/agladstein/SimPrily)\n* [CyVerse Discovery Environment SimPrily Workflow]()\n  1.

Given the importance of computational\nefficiency, TDAstats naturally uses Ripser behind the scenes for homology\ncalculations, using the Rcpp package to integrate the C++ code into an R\npipeline (Ripser for R).\n\n2.  *Statistical inference of persistent homology*: persistent homology can be\nused in hypothesis testing to compare the topological structure of two point\nclouds. TDAstats uses a permutation test in conjunction with the Wasserstein\nmetric for nonparametric statistical inference.\n\n3.  *Visualization of persistent homology*: persistent homology is visualized\nusing two types of plots - persistence diagrams and topological barcodes.\nTDAstats provides implementations of both plot types using the\n[ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)\nframework. Having ggplot2 underlying the plots confers many advantages to the\nuser, including generation of publication-quality plots and customization using\nthe ggplot object returned by TDAstats.\n\n## Contribute\n\nTo contribute to TDAstats, you can create issues for any bugs/suggestions on the [issues page](https://github.com/rrrlw/TDAstats/issues). You can also fork the TDAstats repository and create pull requests to add features you think will be useful for users.\n\n## Real-world applications, use cases, and mentions\n\n* Gommel M.

analysis.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install TDAstats, run the following R code:\n```r\n# install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"TDAstats\")\n\n# install development version from GitHub\ndevtools::install_github(\"rrrlw/TDAstats\")\n\n# install development version with vignettes/tutorials\ndevtools::install_github(\"rrrlw/TDAstats\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n```\n\n## Sample code\n\nThe following sample code creates two synthetic datasets, and calculates and visualizes their persistent homology to showcase the use of TDAstats.\n\n```r\n# load TDAstats\nlibrary(\"TDAstats\")\n\n# load sample datasets\ndata(\"unif2d\")\ndata(\"circle2d\")\n\n# calculate persistent homology for both datasets\nunif.phom <- calculate_homology(unif2d, dim = 1)\ncirc.phom <- calculate_homology(circle2d, dim = 1)\n\n# visualize first dataset as persistence diagram\nplot_persist(unif.phom)\n\n# visualize second dataset as topological barcode\nplot_barcode(circ.phom)\n```\n\nA more detailed tutorial can be found in the package vignettes or at [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/rrrlw/2fd22a834a883cb66454b1dabab9fdcb).\n\n## Functionality\n\nTDAstats has 3 primary goals:\n\n1.  *Calculation of persistent homology*: the C++\n[Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser)\nproject is a lightweight library for calculating persistent homology\nthat outpaces all of its competitors. Given the importance of computational\nefficiency, TDAstats naturally uses Ripser behind the scenes for homology\ncalculations, using the Rcpp package to integrate the C++ code into an R\npipeline (Ripser for R).\n\n2.  *Statistical inference of persistent homology*: persistent homology can be\nused in hypothesis testing to compare the topological structure of two point\nclouds. TDAstats uses a permutation test in conjunction with the Wasserstein\nmetric for nonparametric statistical inference.\n\n3.  *Visualization of persistent homology*: persistent homology is visualized\nusing two types of plots - persistence diagrams and topological barcodes.\nTDAstats provides implementations of both plot types using the\n[ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)\nframework. Having ggplot2 underlying the plots confers many advantages to the\nuser, including generation of publication-quality plots and customization using\nthe ggplot object returned by TDAstats.\n\n## Contribute\n\nTo contribute to TDAstats, you can create issues for any bugs/suggestions on the [issues page](https://github.com/rrrlw/TDAstats/issues). You can also fork the TDAstats repository and create pull requests to add features you think will be useful for users.\n\n## Real-world applications, use cases, and mentions\n\n* Gommel M.

Bioinformatics, 35(14), i436-i445. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz363\n \nThe source code in this project can be used to reproduce the results\ndescribed in the paper. Additionally, the pipeline can be easily\nextended to test novel methods against the state-of-the art.\n\nRunning the pipeline will generate an interactive HTML report using\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which is equivalent\nto the one available on\n[icbi-lab.github.io/immune_deconvolution_benchmark](https://icbi-lab.github.io/immune_deconvolution_benchmark)\n\n**All (preprocessed) data needed to reproduce the results**:\n[data.tar.gz](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc1/data.tar.gz)\n\n## Getting started\nShort version:\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.git\ncd immune_deconvolution_benchmark\n#<add CIBERSORT source code; see below (optional)>\nsnakemake get_cache  # download some precomputed files to speed up the build process (optional)\nsnakemake --use-conda\n```\n\nFor details, see below.\n\nIf you have trouble running the pipeline first, see the [FAQ](#FAQ) then report an issue on GitHub. \n\n### Prerequisites\nThis pipeline uses [Anaconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and\n[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\n1. **Download and install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)**\n2. **Install snakemake**\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake\n```\n\n3. **Clone this repo.** We use a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) to import\nthe source code for the [immundeconv](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv) R package.\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.git\n```\n\nIf you have problems retrieving the submodule, read this [question on\nstackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules).\n\n\n### Licenses\nWhile this pipeline is free software, you may require a license to run the individual methods. \nPlease see [this table](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv/blob/master/README.md#available-methods-licenses-citations) for more information. In particular, CIBERSORT and EPIC are free for non-commercial use only. Additional steps are required to include CIBERSORT into the pipeline (see below). \n\n#### EPIC\nEPIC is published under an [Academic License](https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC/blob/master/LICENSE) restricting its use to non-commercial applications. If you plan to use this pipeline in a commerical setting, you need to obtain a license [from the authors](https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC#contact-information). If you with to exclude EPIC from the pipeline, you can do so in `notebooks/config.R`. \n\n#### CIBERSORT\nDue to licensing restrictions, CIBERSORT could not be included in this repo.\nYou have to go to the [CIBERSORT website](https://cibersort.stanford.edu),\nobtain a license and download the source code.\n\nPlace the files `CIBERSORT.R` and `LM22.txt` in the\n```\nlibs/CIBERSORT/\n```\nfolder of this repository.\n\nAlternatively, you can adjust the paths in `notebooks/config.R`\n\nIf CIBERSORT is not available, it will automatically be excluded from the\nanalysis (see `notebooks/config.R` for more details).\n\n\n### Computational resources and caching\nRunning the full pipeline can take a lot of time and computational resources.\nIn particular the sensitivity and specificity analysis do a lot of simulations.\n\nThe pipeline internally generates caches to speed up repetitive builds.\nTo eradicate all caches, use\n```\nsnakemake wipe\n```\n\nBy default, the pipline uses up to 16 cores and requires up to 12GB of\nmemory per core. You can adjust the number of cores in [notebooks/config.R](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/blob/ce5684bae11a16784547b00719f1ab51795dbf2c/notebooks/config.R#L3).\n\nThe runtime of the pipeline can be several hours, depending on the number of cores.\n\n\n### Run the pipeline\nTo perform all computations and to generate a HTML report with\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) invoke\nthe corresponding `Snakemake` target:\n\n```\nsnakemake --use-conda book\n```\n\nMake sure to use the `--use-conda` flag to tell Snakemake to download all dependencies from Anaconda.org.\n\nThe pipeline will generate a `results` folder.\nThe HTML report with all figures and results will be available in\n`results/book`.\n\n\n### Useful Snakemake targets.\nHave a look at the `Snakefile`, it is self-explanatory.\n\nA list of the most useful targets\n```\nsnakemake --use-conda book       # generate a HTML-book in `results/book`\nsnakemake --use-conda            # default target (= book)\nsnakemake clean                  # cleans the HTML book\nsnakemake wipe                   # cleans everything, including all caches.\nsnakemake get_cache              # downloads precomputed results for sensitivity and specificity\n```\n\n## FAQ\n### 1. The pipeline fails with a weird error message. \nA likely reason for that is that you don't have enough RAM per core. Try to reduce the maximum number of cores in [notebooks/config.R](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/blob/ce5684bae11a16784547b00719f1ab51795dbf2c/notebooks/config.R#L3) until you have at least 12GB of RAM per core. \n\nThis happens when the pipeline breaks out of a parallel for loop. A possible error message is \n```\nError in names(object) <- nm : \n  'names' attribute [10] must be the same length as the vector [0]\nCalls: <Anonymous> ... getResult -> getResult.iforeach -> <Anonymous> -> setNames\n```\nwhich does not really hint at a lack of memory. Others might be possible if the pipeline fails at other stages. \n\n### 2. Can I test my own method?\nYes, you need to write a small wrapper function. \nSee [below](#test-your-own-method). \n\n### 3. Can I use my own dataset (FACS or scRNA-seq) in the pipeline?\nNo, not out-of-the-box. \nFeel free to use the Rmarkdown notebooks in [notebooks](notebooks) as a template. It should be fairly easy\nto edit them e.g. in Rstudio and adjust the datasets. \n\n\n## Test your own method\n\nOur pipeline is designed in a way that you can easily test your own method and benchmark it against the\nstate-of-the-art. All you have to do is to write an `R` function within the `immunedeconv` package that calls your\nmethod.\n\nHere we demonstrate how to implement and test a method step-by-step using a nonsense random predictor.\n\nIn brief, this is what we need to do:\n\n1. Add the new method to the `immunedeconv` package\n2. Map the output cell types of the method to the controlled vocabulary\n3. Adjust pipeline configuration (optional)\n4. Run the pipeline\n\n### Add the new method to the `immunedeconv` package\nThe sourcecode of the `immunedeconv` package is located in `./immunedeconv`. The pipeline always loads this package from the source code there.\n\n1. **Go to the package and checkout a new branch**\n\n```bash\ncd immunedeconv\ngit checkout -b new_method\n```\n\n2. **Edit the file `R/immune_deconvolution_methods.R`**\n\nFirst, we add our method to the 'list of supported methods'.\nThe first value corresponds to the \"display name\", that will be shown in\nthe report, the second value to the internal name of the method that\nwill later be passed to the `deconvolute()` function.\n\n```r\ndeconvolution_methods = c(\"MCPcounter\"=\"mcp_counter\",\n                          \"EPIC\"=\"epic\",\n                          \"quanTIseq\"=\"quantiseq\",\n                          \"xCell\"=\"xcell\",\n                          \"CIBERSORT\"=\"cibersort\",\n                          \"CIBERSORT (abs.)\"=\"cibersort_abs\",\n                          \"TIMER\"=\"timer\",\n                          \"random pred.\"=\"random\") # <- method added here\n```\n\nNext, we add a new deconvolution function for our method.\n\n* Input: gene expression matrix (cols = samples, rows = genes, rownames = HGNC symbols, colnames = sample names)\n* Output: A matrix with immune cell estimates (cols = samples, rows = cell types,\nrownames = cell type name, colnames = sample names from input)\n\nNote that you can use `system()` to call an arbitrary command line tool.\n\nIn our case, we add\n```r\n#' Deconvolute using the awseome RANDOM technique\n#'\n#' Here is a good place to add some documentation.\ndeconvolute_random = function(gene_expression_matrix) {\n  # list of the cell types we want to 'predict'\n  cell_types = c(\"CD4+ Tcell\", \"CD8+ Tcell\", \"NK cell\", \"Macrophage\",\n                 \"Monocyte\")\n  n_samples = ncol(gene_expression_matrix)\n\n  # generate random values\n  results = matrix(runif(length(cell_types) * n_samples), ncol=n_samples)\n\n  # rescale the values to sum to 1 for each sample\n  results = apply(results, 2, function(x) {x/sum(x)})\n  rownames(results) = cell_types\n  colnames(results) = colnames(gene_expression_matrix)\n\n  results\n}\n```\n\nFinally, register the new method in the generic `deconvolute()` function.\n```r\ndeconvolute = function(gene_expression, method=deconvolution_methods, indications=NULL) {\n  message(paste0(\"\\n\", \">>> Running \", method))\n  # run selected method\n  res = switch(method,\n         xcell = deconvolute_xcell(gene_expression),\n         mcp_counter = deconvolute_mcp_counter(gene_expression),\n         epic = deconvolute_epic(gene_expression),\n         quantiseq = deconvolute_quantiseq(gene_expression),\n         cibersort = deconvolute_cibersort(gene_expression, absolute = FALSE),\n         cibersort_abs = deconvolute_cibersort(gene_expression, absolute = TRUE),\n         timer = deconvolute_timer(gene_expression, indications=indications),\n         random = deconvolute_random(gene_expression)   # <- method added here\n         )\n\n  # convert to tibble and annotate unified cell_type names\n  res = res %>%\n    as_tibble(rownames=\"method_cell_type\") %>%\n    annotate_cell_type(method=method)\n\n  return(res)\n}\n```\n\nTo check everything, run the unit tests of the `immunedeconv` package.\nInvoke the following command from the root of the main repository:\n```bash\nsnakemake --use-conda test_immunedeconv\n```\n\nNote that the tests can take some while, and warnings regarding the convergence of EPIC are expected.\n\n\n### Map the output cell types to the controlled vocabulary\nOpen the file `immunedeconv/inst/extdata/cell_type_mapping.xlsx` in Excel or\nOpenOffice.\n\nMap the cell types to the controlled vocabulary.\n* The first column corresponds to the method name\n* The second column (`method_cell_type`) corresponds to the cell types, as\n  named by the method\n* The third column (`cell_type`) corresponds to the corresponding cell type\n  entity from the controlled vocabulary.\n\n![screenshot mapping](img/screenshot_mapping.png)\n\n\n### Adjust pipeline configuration (optional)\nHave a look at the configuration file:\n```\nnotebooks/config.R\n```\n\nHere, we can specify where our new random method will be used in \nthe benchmark. We add our random predictor to the set of methods that\nwill be benchmarked in terms of *absolute deviations* from the\nreal score (not supported by all methods):\n\n```r\n############## Specify methods used in the benchmark ##################\n\n# these methods will be used in the benchmark.

Bioinformatics, 35(14), i436-i445. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz363\n \nThe source code in this project can be used to reproduce the results\ndescribed in the paper. Additionally, the pipeline can be easily\nextended to test novel methods against the state-of-the art.\n\nRunning the pipeline will generate an interactive HTML report using\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which is equivalent\nto the one available on\n[icbi-lab.github.io/immune_deconvolution_benchmark](https://icbi-lab.github.io/immune_deconvolution_benchmark)\n\n**All (preprocessed) data needed to reproduce the results**:\n[data.tar.gz](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc1/data.tar.gz)\n\n## Getting started\nShort version:\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.git\ncd immune_deconvolution_benchmark\n#<add CIBERSORT source code; see below (optional)>\nsnakemake get_cache  # download some precomputed files to speed up the build process (optional)\nsnakemake --use-conda\n```\n\nFor details, see below.\n\nIf you have trouble running the pipeline first, see the [FAQ](#FAQ) then report an issue on GitHub. \n\n### Prerequisites\nThis pipeline uses [Anaconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and\n[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\n1. **Download and install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)**\n2. **Install snakemake**\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake\n```\n\n3. **Clone this repo.** We use a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) to import\nthe source code for the [immundeconv](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv) R package.\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.git\n```\n\nIf you have problems retrieving the submodule, read this [question on\nstackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules).\n\n\n### Licenses\nWhile this pipeline is free software, you may require a license to run the individual methods. \nPlease see [this table](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv/blob/master/README.md#available-methods-licenses-citations) for more information. In particular, CIBERSORT and EPIC are free for non-commercial use only. Additional steps are required to include CIBERSORT into the pipeline (see below). \n\n#### EPIC\nEPIC is published under an [Academic License](https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC/blob/master/LICENSE) restricting its use to non-commercial applications. If you plan to use this pipeline in a commerical setting, you need to obtain a license [from the authors](https://github.com/GfellerLab/EPIC#contact-information). If you with to exclude EPIC from the pipeline, you can do so in `notebooks/config.R`. \n\n#### CIBERSORT\nDue to licensing restrictions, CIBERSORT could not be included in this repo.\nYou have to go to the [CIBERSORT website](https://cibersort.stanford.edu),\nobtain a license and download the source code.\n\nPlace the files `CIBERSORT.R` and `LM22.txt` in the\n```\nlibs/CIBERSORT/\n```\nfolder of this repository.\n\nAlternatively, you can adjust the paths in `notebooks/config.R`\n\nIf CIBERSORT is not available, it will automatically be excluded from the\nanalysis (see `notebooks/config.R` for more details).\n\n\n### Computational resources and caching\nRunning the full pipeline can take a lot of time and computational resources.\nIn particular the sensitivity and specificity analysis do a lot of simulations.\n\nThe pipeline internally generates caches to speed up repetitive builds.\nTo eradicate all caches, use\n```\nsnakemake wipe\n```\n\nBy default, the pipline uses up to 16 cores and requires up to 12GB of\nmemory per core. You can adjust the number of cores in [notebooks/config.R](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/blob/ce5684bae11a16784547b00719f1ab51795dbf2c/notebooks/config.R#L3).\n\nThe runtime of the pipeline can be several hours, depending on the number of cores.\n\n\n### Run the pipeline\nTo perform all computations and to generate a HTML report with\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) invoke\nthe corresponding `Snakemake` target:\n\n```\nsnakemake --use-conda book\n```\n\nMake sure to use the `--use-conda` flag to tell Snakemake to download all dependencies from Anaconda.org.\n\nThe pipeline will generate a `results` folder.\nThe HTML report with all figures and results will be available in\n`results/book`.\n\n\n### Useful Snakemake targets.\nHave a look at the `Snakefile`, it is self-explanatory.\n\nA list of the most useful targets\n```\nsnakemake --use-conda book       # generate a HTML-book in `results/book`\nsnakemake --use-conda            # default target (= book)\nsnakemake clean                  # cleans the HTML book\nsnakemake wipe                   # cleans everything, including all caches.\nsnakemake get_cache              # downloads precomputed results for sensitivity and specificity\n```\n\n## FAQ\n### 1. The pipeline fails with a weird error message. \nA likely reason for that is that you don't have enough RAM per core. Try to reduce the maximum number of cores in [notebooks/config.R](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immune_deconvolution_benchmark/blob/ce5684bae11a16784547b00719f1ab51795dbf2c/notebooks/config.R#L3) until you have at least 12GB of RAM per core. \n\nThis happens when the pipeline breaks out of a parallel for loop. A possible error message is \n```\nError in names(object) <- nm : \n  'names' attribute [10] must be the same length as the vector [0]\nCalls: <Anonymous> ... getResult -> getResult.iforeach -> <Anonymous> -> setNames\n```\nwhich does not really hint at a lack of memory. Others might be possible if the pipeline fails at other stages. \n\n### 2. Can I test my own method?\nYes, you need to write a small wrapper function. \nSee [below](#test-your-own-method). \n\n### 3. Can I use my own dataset (FACS or scRNA-seq) in the pipeline?\nNo, not out-of-the-box. \nFeel free to use the Rmarkdown notebooks in [notebooks](notebooks) as a template. It should be fairly easy\nto edit them e.g. in Rstudio and adjust the datasets. \n\n\n## Test your own method\n\nOur pipeline is designed in a way that you can easily test your own method and benchmark it against the\nstate-of-the-art. All you have to do is to write an `R` function within the `immunedeconv` package that calls your\nmethod.\n\nHere we demonstrate how to implement and test a method step-by-step using a nonsense random predictor.\n\nIn brief, this is what we need to do:\n\n1. Add the new method to the `immunedeconv` package\n2. Map the output cell types of the method to the controlled vocabulary\n3. Adjust pipeline configuration (optional)\n4. Run the pipeline\n\n### Add the new method to the `immunedeconv` package\nThe sourcecode of the `immunedeconv` package is located in `./immunedeconv`. The pipeline always loads this package from the source code there.\n\n1. **Go to the package and checkout a new branch**\n\n```bash\ncd immunedeconv\ngit checkout -b new_method\n```\n\n2. **Edit the file `R/immune_deconvolution_methods.R`**\n\nFirst, we add our method to the 'list of supported methods'.\nThe first value corresponds to the \"display name\", that will be shown in\nthe report, the second value to the internal name of the method that\nwill later be passed to the `deconvolute()` function.\n\n```r\ndeconvolution_methods = c(\"MCPcounter\"=\"mcp_counter\",\n                          \"EPIC\"=\"epic\",\n                          \"quanTIseq\"=\"quantiseq\",\n                          \"xCell\"=\"xcell\",\n                          \"CIBERSORT\"=\"cibersort\",\n                          \"CIBERSORT (abs.)\"=\"cibersort_abs\",\n                          \"TIMER\"=\"timer\",\n                          \"random pred.\"=\"random\") # <- method added here\n```\n\nNext, we add a new deconvolution function for our method.\n\n* Input: gene expression matrix (cols = samples, rows = genes, rownames = HGNC symbols, colnames = sample names)\n* Output: A matrix with immune cell estimates (cols = samples, rows = cell types,\nrownames = cell type name, colnames = sample names from input)\n\nNote that you can use `system()` to call an arbitrary command line tool.\n\nIn our case, we add\n```r\n#' Deconvolute using the awseome RANDOM technique\n#'\n#' Here is a good place to add some documentation.\ndeconvolute_random = function(gene_expression_matrix) {\n  # list of the cell types we want to 'predict'\n  cell_types = c(\"CD4+ Tcell\", \"CD8+ Tcell\", \"NK cell\", \"Macrophage\",\n                 \"Monocyte\")\n  n_samples = ncol(gene_expression_matrix)\n\n  # generate random values\n  results = matrix(runif(length(cell_types) * n_samples), ncol=n_samples)\n\n  # rescale the values to sum to 1 for each sample\n  results = apply(results, 2, function(x) {x/sum(x)})\n  rownames(results) = cell_types\n  colnames(results) = colnames(gene_expression_matrix)\n\n  results\n}\n```\n\nFinally, register the new method in the generic `deconvolute()` function.\n```r\ndeconvolute = function(gene_expression, method=deconvolution_methods, indications=NULL) {\n  message(paste0(\"\\n\", \">>> Running \", method))\n  # run selected method\n  res = switch(method,\n         xcell = deconvolute_xcell(gene_expression),\n         mcp_counter = deconvolute_mcp_counter(gene_expression),\n         epic = deconvolute_epic(gene_expression),\n         quantiseq = deconvolute_quantiseq(gene_expression),\n         cibersort = deconvolute_cibersort(gene_expression, absolute = FALSE),\n         cibersort_abs = deconvolute_cibersort(gene_expression, absolute = TRUE),\n         timer = deconvolute_timer(gene_expression, indications=indications),\n         random = deconvolute_random(gene_expression)   # <- method added here\n         )\n\n  # convert to tibble and annotate unified cell_type names\n  res = res %>%\n    as_tibble(rownames=\"method_cell_type\") %>%\n    annotate_cell_type(method=method)\n\n  return(res)\n}\n```\n\nTo check everything, run the unit tests of the `immunedeconv` package.\nInvoke the following command from the root of the main repository:\n```bash\nsnakemake --use-conda test_immunedeconv\n```\n\nNote that the tests can take some while, and warnings regarding the convergence of EPIC are expected.\n\n\n### Map the output cell types to the controlled vocabulary\nOpen the file `immunedeconv/inst/extdata/cell_type_mapping.xlsx` in Excel or\nOpenOffice.\n\nMap the cell types to the controlled vocabulary.\n* The first column corresponds to the method name\n* The second column (`method_cell_type`) corresponds to the cell types, as\n  named by the method\n* The third column (`cell_type`) corresponds to the corresponding cell type\n  entity from the controlled vocabulary.\n\n![screenshot mapping](img/screenshot_mapping.png)\n\n\n### Adjust pipeline configuration (optional)\nHave a look at the configuration file:\n```\nnotebooks/config.R\n```\n\nHere, we can specify where our new random method will be used in \nthe benchmark. We add our random predictor to the set of methods that\nwill be benchmarked in terms of *absolute deviations* from the\nreal score (not supported by all methods):\n\n```r\n############## Specify methods used in the benchmark ##################\n\n# these methods will be used in the benchmark. Default: Use all methods\n# provided by the `immundeconv` package. \nconfig$deconvolution_methods = immunedeconv::deconvolution_methods\n\n# these methods will be treated as 'absolute' methods in the mixing benchmark\nconfig$abs_methods_mixing = c(\"cibersort_abs\", \"epic\", \"quantiseq\", \"xcell\", \"random\")\n\n# these methods will be shown as 'absolute' methods in the validation benchmark\nconfig$abs_methods_validation = c(\"cibersort_abs\", \"quantiseq\", \"epic\", \"random\")\n\n# these methods provide scores that support within-sample comparisons\nconfig$methods_within_sample_comparison = c(\"cibersort\", \"cibersort_abs\", \"quantiseq\", \"epic\")\n```\n\n### Run the pipeline\n\n```bash\nsnakemake wipe   # use this command to clear up previous results and to eradicate the cache\nsnakemake --use-conda book\n```\n"}, "ColeLab/CombinedFC": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "ColeLab/CombinedFC", "diskUsage": 1287540, "name": "CombinedFC", "owner": {"login": "ColeLab"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}, {"name": "Jupyter Notebook"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-10-29T00:06:40Z", "pushedAt": "2019-12-18T01:22:25Z", "object": {"text": "# CombinedFC Toolbox\n## Repository for the combinedFC project (Sanchez-Romero &amp; Cole, 2019)\n_Beta version_\n\n## Citation\nSanchez-Romero, R., Cole, M.W.

[10.1101/083451](http://doi.org/10.1101/083451)\n\nThe idea for this paper came from a presentation at Intecol 2013 in London:\n\nFalster, Daniel (2013): **Growth trajectories: a new way of understanding the influence of traits on plant growth**. [10.6084/m9.figshare.775379](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.775379)\n\n# Instructions\n\nThe code included should enabled you to recreate nearly-all the figures from the paper and the supplementary material.\n\nI say \"nearly-all\" because the code to reproduce figures S1-S2 may no longer run, depending on what version of R and rstan you have installed. These figures were generated by fitting models using the [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html) package. Frequent and substantial changes in the rstan package since the code was developed in 2016 mean it no longer compiles and runs, as it did back then. For posterity sake, the original code is included, but I have separated out figures S1-S2 as optional targets in the build.\n\nReproducing the other figures will take < 5min, once you have the correct packages installed.\n\n## Installing relevant software\n\nAll analyses were done in `R`. You need to [download this repository](https://github.com/traitecoevo/growth_trajectories/archive/master.zip), and then open an R session with working directory set to the root of the project.\n\n### Remake\n\nTo compile the figures figures and supplementary material we use the [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) package for R. You can install remake using the `devtools` package (run `install.packages(\"devtools\")` to install devtools if needed):\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/storr\", dependencies=TRUE)\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/remake\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\n### Plant\n\nThe analysis is based heavily on the [plant](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant) package for R. To be guaranteed of recreating the figures, make sure you install `v1.1.0`, as follows. You must be using R 3.3.0 or newer. At this stage the package is not on CRAN. You're options for installing are described below.\n\nInstallation requires a C++11 compatible C compiler (OSX >= 10.10/Yosemite satisfies this, as do standard linux Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04). On Windows machines you will need to install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).\n\nThe `plant` package can be installed direct from github using the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package. `plant` also requires the packages `loggr` and `RcppR6` packages. Install those with\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"smbache/loggr\", dependencies=TRUE)\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/RcppR6\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\nThen install version 1.1.0 of plant:\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"traitecoevo/plant\", ref = \"v1.1.0\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\n### The Biomass and Allometry Database\n\nFigure S2 uses data from the [Biomass and Allometry Database](https://github.com/dfalster/baad). Access to that dataset is obtained via installing the [baad.data](https://github.com/traitecoevo/baad.data) package:\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/datastorr\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"traitecoevo/baad.data\")\n```\n\n### Other\n\nWe use a number of other packages, which can be easily installed by remake if they are missing:\n\n```r\nremake::install_missing_packages()\n```\n\nFinally, compiling the figure 1 and the paper requires a reasonably complete LaTeX installation (e.g. [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for OSX or [MikTex](http://miktex.org/) for windows). The LaTeX compilation will depend on a few packages from CTAN, make sure to allow automatic package installation by your LaTeX distribution.\n\n### Recreating the figures\n\nTo generate all figures run:\n\n```r\nremake::make()\n```\n\nTo make only one of the figures, run a command like\n\n```r\nremake::make(\"output/main/lcp_schematic.pdf\")\n```\n\nThe list of targets can be gleaned from the file `remake.yml`.\n\nIf you find remake confusing and prefer to run plain R, checkout out the file [`analysis.R`](analysis.R) for instructions in plain old vanilla R.\n"}, "ref": {"target":

DS[![](https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9814-092X), Duursma R, FitzJohn R (2018) **How functional traits influence plant growth**. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA* doi: [10.1073/pnas.1714044115](http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714044115)\n\nalso available as a preprint at\n\nFalster DS, Duursma R, FitzJohn R (2016) **Growth trajectories: how functional traits influence plant growth**. *bioRxiv*: 083451. [10.1101/083451](http://doi.org/10.1101/083451)\n\nThe idea for this paper came from a presentation at Intecol 2013 in London:\n\nFalster, Daniel (2013): **Growth trajectories: a new way of understanding the influence of traits on plant growth**. [10.6084/m9.figshare.775379](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.775379)\n\n# Instructions\n\nThe code included should enabled you to recreate nearly-all the figures from the paper and the supplementary material.\n\nI say \"nearly-all\" because the code to reproduce figures S1-S2 may no longer run, depending on what version of R and rstan you have installed. These figures were generated by fitting models using the [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html) package. Frequent and substantial changes in the rstan package since the code was developed in 2016 mean it no longer compiles and runs, as it did back then. For posterity sake, the original code is included, but I have separated out figures S1-S2 as optional targets in the build.\n\nReproducing the other figures will take < 5min, once you have the correct packages installed.\n\n## Installing relevant software\n\nAll analyses were done in `R`. You need to [download this repository](https://github.com/traitecoevo/growth_trajectories/archive/master.zip), and then open an R session with working directory set to the root of the project.\n\n### Remake\n\nTo compile the figures figures and supplementary material we use the [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) package for R. You can install remake using the `devtools` package (run `install.packages(\"devtools\")` to install devtools if needed):\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/storr\", dependencies=TRUE)\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/remake\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\n### Plant\n\nThe analysis is based heavily on the [plant](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant) package for R. To be guaranteed of recreating the figures, make sure you install `v1.1.0`, as follows. You must be using R 3.3.0 or newer. At this stage the package is not on CRAN. You're options for installing are described below.\n\nInstallation requires a C++11 compatible C compiler (OSX >= 10.10/Yosemite satisfies this, as do standard linux Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04). On Windows machines you will need to install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).\n\nThe `plant` package can be installed direct from github using the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package. `plant` also requires the packages `loggr` and `RcppR6` packages. Install those with\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"smbache/loggr\", dependencies=TRUE)\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/RcppR6\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\nThen install version 1.1.0 of plant:\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"traitecoevo/plant\", ref = \"v1.1.0\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\n### The Biomass and Allometry Database\n\nFigure S2 uses data from the [Biomass and Allometry Database](https://github.com/dfalster/baad). Access to that dataset is obtained via installing the [baad.data](https://github.com/traitecoevo/baad.data) package:\n\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"richfitz/datastorr\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"traitecoevo/baad.data\")\n```\n\n### Other\n\nWe use a number of other packages, which can be easily installed by remake if they are missing:\n\n```r\nremake::install_missing_packages()\n```\n\nFinally, compiling the figure 1 and the paper requires a reasonably complete LaTeX installation (e.g. [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for OSX or [MikTex](http://miktex.org/) for windows). The LaTeX compilation will depend on a few packages from CTAN, make sure to allow automatic package installation by your LaTeX distribution.\n\n### Recreating the figures\n\nTo generate all figures run:\n\n```r\nremake::make()\n```\n\nTo make only one of the figures, run a command like\n\n```r\nremake::make(\"output/main/lcp_schematic.pdf\")\n```\n\nThe list of targets can be gleaned from the file `remake.yml`.\n\nIf you find remake confusing and prefer to run plain R, checkout out the file [`analysis.R`](analysis.R) for instructions in plain old vanilla R.\n"}, "jensengroup/RegioSQM": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "jensengroup/RegioSQM", "diskUsage": 39, "name": "RegioSQM", "owner": {"login": "jensengroup"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2017-03-08T11:32:20Z", "pushedAt": "2018-02-13T14:01:46Z", "object": {"text": "# RegioSQM\n\nAvaliable on [regioqm.org](http://regiosqm.org).\n\nPredict Regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions in\nheteroaromatic systems.\nRegioSQM finds the aromatic CH group with the highest proton affinity estimated\nby the PM3/COSMO method using the MOPAC program.\nMore information is available at the [RegioSQM paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7SC04156J).\n\n# Installation\n\n    - MOPAC (http://openmopac.net/)\n    - RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)\n    - obabel (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)\n\nRegioSQM depends on MOPAC for quantum calculations, OpenBabel for some\nformation convertion and RDkit in the python enviroment for everything else.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe workflow is as following\n\n    cd example\n\t\n    # generate conformations from SMILES\n    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -g example.csv > example.csv\n\t\n    # Run all .mop files with mopac\n    # or submit them to a cluster\n    ls *mop | parallel -j4 \"mopac {}\"\n\t\n    # use the generated csv file to analyse all the \n    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -a example.csv example.csv > example_results.csv\n\n\nThe results are now parseable from the results file, or viewable by 2D structures with regioselective indicators (in svg format).\n\n\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 52, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "221ee65cbf5e6c19d9f6d43b8d5227ae612ba269 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-13T15:01:33+01:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-13T14:01:47Z", "messageHeadline": "remove old sh", "message": "remove old sh"}}, {"node": {"additions": 21, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-13T14:58:04+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "license back", "message": "license back"}}, {"node": {"additions": 829, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-13T14:56:51+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'local/master'", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'local/master'"}}, {"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-13T14:54:30+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "clean", "message": "clean"}}, {"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-11T10:56:45+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "only use obabel w/o path", "message": "only use obabel w/o path"}}, {"node": {"additions": 24, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-11T10:56:19+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "readme update", "message": "readme update"}}, {"node": {"additions": 57, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2018-02-10T21:00:37+01:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "update for testing", "message": "update for testing"}}, {"node": {"additions": 7, "author": {"name": "Jimmy Charnley Kromann", "email": "jimmy@charnley.dk", "date": "2017-10-23T15:26:12+02:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "bug fixes", "message": "bug fixes"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Jan H.

This software toolkit is being developed as part of the [Kurator project](http://wiki.datakurator.net/wiki/Kurator) and is designed to make it easy to develop and run high-performance data cleaning workflows.\n\n**Kurator-Akka** is based on the [Akka actor toolkit and runtime](http://akka.io).  It aims to accelerate development of new data cleaning actors and to facilitate development of new workflows assembled from these actors.  **Kurator-Akka** supports actors implemented either in Java or Python, and the framework shields actor developers from the complexities of using the Akka API directly.  Workflows are specified using a YAML-based language that defines how data flows between the actors at run time.\n\nThe remainder of this README provides simple examples of actors and workflows that employ Kurator-Akka, describes how to run example workflows at the command line, and outlines the setup required to develop with or extend the **Kurator-Akka** source code.  Detailed user documentation will be provided elsewhere.\n\nThe TDWG 2015 presentation [Data cleaning with the Kurator toolkit](http://www.slideshare.net/TimothyMcPhillips/data-cleaning-with-the-kurator-toolkit-bridging-the-gap-between-conventional-scripting-and-highperformance-workflow-automation) provides an overview of the Kurator project and tools described in this README.  Also see the list of publications on the [Kurator project wiki](https://wiki.datakurator.net/wiki/Kurator#Publications).\n\nCiting Kurator-Akka\n-------------------\n\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1068311.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1068311)\n\nObtaining Kurator-Akka\n----------------------\n\nAn executable jar is available in the [current release](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka/releases/latest)\n\nAlso see the [Kurator-Web](http://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/Kurator-Web_User_Documentation) application for running Kurator-Akka workflows through a web interface.\n\nKurator-Akka is available as a dependency in maven central:\n\n    <dependency>\n       <groupId>org.datakurator</groupId>\n       <artifactId>kurator-akka</artifactId>\n       <version>1.0.1</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nExample actor and workflow\n--------------------------\n\nA *workflow* is a collection of actors configured to carry out some set of tasks.  An *actor* is a software component that receives data either from outside the workflow, or from other actors within the same workflow; and either communicates the results of its computations to other actors, or saves the results outside the running workflow.  Actors in a **Kurator-Akka** workflow run concurrently in different threads.\n\n**Kurator-Akka** simplifies use of the underlying Akka actor framework by providing the `KuratorActor` class as an alternative to Akka's `UntypedActor` class.  A sub-class of `UntypedActor`, `KuratorActor` makes scientific-workflow specific capabilities available to actor and workflow authors, most critically through the `onData()` event handling method.  When Akka triggers events handled by  the `UntypedActor.onRecieve()` method, the `KuratorActor` implementation of `onRecieve()` makes calls to the `onData()` methods defined by Kurator-Akka actors.  **Kurator-Akka** further provides automated means for orchestrating actors in ways compatible with computational pipelines typically used to automate scientific workflows.  For example, **Kurator-Akka** correctly times actor initialization and actor shutdown events so that workflow authors need not concern themselves with these otherwise complex--yet critical--workflow management details.\n\nActors in **Kurator-Akka** may be implemented either in Java or in Python.\n\n\n##### Java implementation of a Multiplier actor\n\nThe Java class below defines a simple actor for multiplying an integer by a configurable constant:\n\n    import org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor;\n\n    public class Multiplier extends KuratorActor {\n        public double factor = 1;\n        @Override public void onData(Object i) {\n        \tbroadcast((double)i * factor);\n        }\n    }\n\nAs shown above, a new Java actor can be implemented by declaring a new Java class that overrides the `onData()` method of the `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor` base class.  This method will be called by the **Kurator-Akka** framework each time the actor receives any data.  The call to `broadcast()` within the `onData()` method sends data (usually the results of performing some computation on the data received by the actor) to any other actors in the workflow configured to listen to this one.\n\nAn alternative approach to defining a **Kurator-Akka** Java actor is to implement the actor as a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) and declare to the Kurator-Akka framework which public method is to be called for each received data object. By default the method named `onData()` will be used. This method must be a function that returns the value to be broadcast to other actors.  A POJO implementation of the above Multiplier actor is as follows:\n\n    public class Multiplier {\n        public double factor = 1;\n        public void multiply(Object i) {\n        \treturn((double)i * factor);\n        }\n    }\n\nNo class inheritance is required when using using the POJO approach.  However, POJO actors have the limitation that only one output data item may be returned and communicated to other actors for each input data item the actor receives.  In contrast, Java actors derived from `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor` may call the `broadcast()` method multiple times within the `onData()` method and so produce multiple outputs per input.\n\nBoth approaches for Java actors support event handlers in addition to `onData()`. These include `onInitialize()`, called before any actor produces output; `onStart()`, which allows actors to produce output data before any input data is received; and `onEnd()`, which is called after an actor has handled the last data item it will receive during a workflow run.\n\n##### Python implementations of the Multiplier actor\n\nAn implementation of the same actor in Python is analogous to the POJO approach above, with the difference that the input data handler can, but does not need to be, defined as a method in a class. Any name may be used for the input data handing function; `on_data()` is assumed by default.\n\nThus, the following Python snippet can serve as a valid actor implementaion:\n\n    factor = 1\n    def multiply(i):\n        return factor * i\n\nAnd methods defined in Python classes work as well:\n\n    class MultiplierActor(object):\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.factor = 1\n        def multiply(i):\n            return self.factor * i\n\n\nAs for POJOs, the **Kurator-Akka** framework can be configured to call the `multiply()` function on each data item received by either of the above implementations of the actor.  The value returned from the function is automatically broadcast to listeners.  Unlike POJO actors, actors implemented as Python functions alternatively may produce a sequence of output data items for each input data item received by using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.\n\nSimilar to Java actors, Python actors may provide `on_initialize()`, `on_start()`, and `on_end()` event handlers (and may name these functions arbitrarily).\n\n##### YAML declaration of a Python implementation of the Multiplier actor\n\nIn addition to the Java or Python definition of an actor, an *actor type declaration* authored in YAML is needed to make the actor available for use in workflows.  The following declares that actors of type `Multiplier`, a subtype of `PythonActor`, invoke the `multiply()` function defined in the file `multiplier.py` to handle incoming data:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        script: multiplier.py\n        onData: multiply\n\nThe argument to the `script:` property is an absolute path to the Python file defining the function, or a path relative to the directory in which the workflow is invoked.  A  less fragile way of defining a Python actor is to make the Python script part of a Python package, and use the `module` property to refer to the script.  For example, if `multiplier.py` is in the `math.operators` package, then the following declaration will work:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        module: math.operators.multiplier\n        onData: multiply\n\nA declaration corresponding to a Python class implementation of the actor defined in a `math.actors` package would be as follows:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonClassActor\n      properties:\n        pythonClass: math.actors.MultiplierActor\n        onData: multiply\n\n\nAnalogous declarations must be provided for Java actors as well.\n\n\n##### Defining a workflow that uses the Multiplier actor\n\nWith either of the above YAML snippets saved to a file named `actors.yaml`, the Python-based `Multiplier` actor can be used in a workflow also defined in YAML. The workflow below accepts an input value from the user, multiplies it by 3, and outputs the result:\n\n    imports:\n\n    - file:actors.yaml\n\n    components:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThreeWorkflow\n      type: Workflow\n      properties:\n        actors:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n          - !ref MultiplyByThree\n          - !ref PrintProduct\n\n    - id: ReadOneNumber\n      type: NumReader\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: Multiplier\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        parameters:\n          factor: 3\n\n    - id: PrintProduct\n      type: NumPrinter\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref MultiplyByThree\n\nThe above declaration states the following: `MultiplyByThreeWorkflow` is a workflow comprising three actors, `ReadOneNumber`, `MultiplyByThree`, and `PrintProduct`. `MultiplyByThree` listens to (receives its input from) `ReadOneNumber`, and `PrintProduct` receives its input in turn from `MultiplyByThree`.  `MultiplyByThree` is declared to be an instance of the `Multiplier` actor type defined previously; this instance of `Multiplier` is configured to multiply each value it receives by a factor of 3.  The YAML declarations for the underlying actor types `NumReader`, `Multiplier`, and `NumPrinter` are all imported from `actors.yaml`.\n\nThe YAML definition of a workflow using Java implementations of each actor looks identical to a workflow using Python actors.  Java actors and Python actors can be used together in the same workflow.\n\n##### Inlining Python actors\n\n**Kurator-Akka** allows the code for Python actors to be provided *inline*, i.e. within the workflow definition itself. No additional Python script file or YAML actor type declaration is needed in this case (the type of the actor is simply `PythonActor`).  For example, the block of YAML defining the `MultiplyByThree` actor in the workflow definition above depends on an additional YAML declaration for the `Multiplier` actor defined in the `actors.yaml` file, which in turn depends on a Python script file named `multiplier.py`.  Because the code for this actor is only a few lines long, it may be reasonable to define the actor entirely inline.  In other words, this block of YAML in the workflow:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: Multiplier\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        parameters:\n          factor: 3\n\ncan be replaced with:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        onData: triple\n        code: |\n          def triple(n):\n            return 3 * n\n\nThe Python code defining the `multiply()` function is now defined within the same YAML file that declares the workflow as a whole. Inlined Python actors are useful for implementing simple actors needed for specific workflows.\n\n\nPreparing to run Kurator-Akka\n-----------------------------\n\nThis section describes how to set up an environment for writing your own actors and workflows, and executing them using **Kurator-Akka**. Instructions for building and extending the **Kurator-Akka** framework itself are provided following this section.\n\n#### Check installed version of Java\n**Kurator-Akka** requires Java version 1.8.0 or higher. To determine the version of java installed on your computer use the `-version` option to the `java` command. For example,\n\n    $ java -version\n    java version \"1.8.0_65\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)\n\n\nInstructions for installing Java may be found at [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html).  If you plan to develop new actors in Java (not just in Python) be sure to install the JDK.  Otherwise a JRE is sufficient.\n\n#### Download the Kurator-Akka jar\n\n**Kurator-Akka** is distributed as an executable jar (Java archive) file that can be invoked using the `java -jar` command. To download the most recent build of the latest **Kurator-Akka** code, navigate to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka/releases/latest) and click on the `kurator-akka-1.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar` link under the *Assets* tab to download the *executable jar* artifact for the *kurator-akka* job.\n\n#### Install Kurator-Akka on your system\n\nOnce you have downloaded the **Kurator-Akka** jar, save the file in a convenient location and rename it to something like `kurator-akka.jar`.   **Kurator-Akka** can now be run using the `java -jar` command. The jar file includes several sample workflow scripts which can be accessed from the command line.\n\nTest your installation by running the `hello.yaml` workflow. Assuming `kurator-akka.jar` is in your current working directory type:\n\n    java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n\nIf the Kurator-Akka jar is stored elsewhere, qualify `kurator-akka.jar` with the path to that file. For example, if you stored the jar file in the bin subdirectory of your home directory, running Kurator-Akka would look something like this on Linux or OS X:\n\n    $ java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nOn Windows platforms the command is similar:\n\n    $ java -jar %USERPROFILE%\\bin\\kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\n#### Define a short command for running Kurator-Akka at the prompt\n\nIf you are running **Kurator-Akka** on an Apple OSX or Linux system (or use Git Bash or Cygwin on Windows), you may define an *alias* to simplify running **Kurator-Akka** at the command line. On Windows platforms you similarly may define a *doskey macro* for running **Kurator-Akka** at the prompt.\n\nFor example, if you have saved `kurator-akka.jar` to the bin subdirectory of your home directory, the following command will create a `bash` alias for running **Kurator-Akka** simply by typing `ka`:\n\n    alias ka='java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar'\n\nIf you use `csh` or `tcsh` the command is:\n\n    alias kurator-akka java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar\n\nOn Windows the command to create the `ka` doskey macro is:\n\n     doskey ka=java -jar %USERPROFILE%\\bin\\kurator-akka.jar $*\n\nOn all platforms the `hello.yaml` demo now can be run using the short command:\n\n    $ ka -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\n#### Extract and run sample workflows (optional)\n\nIf you would like to browse and edit the sample workflows included in the **Kurator-Akka** jar, type the following (qualifying the path to `kurator-akka.jar` as necessary) to extract its contents to your filesystem:\n\n    jar xf kurator-akka.jar org/kurator/akka/samples\n\nTo run a script residing on the filesystem, you can use the `file:` qualifier instead of `classpath:`:\n\n    $ java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f file:org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nThe `file:` qualifier is optional, however. By default **Kurator-Akka** looks for workflows on your filesystem. So this will work, too:\n\n\n    $ java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nNote that the path to `hello.yaml` above is relative (it does not start with a `/`).\n\n\nDeveloping new Java actors\n-------------------------------\nNew Java actors can be implemented using standard Java development tools.  Simply make sure that the `kurator-akka.jar` file is on the CLASSPATH when compiling your actors, and that the compiled `.class` files are on the CLASSPATH when running **Kurator-Akka**.\n\nFor example, if your new actor is defined in the file `MyActor.java`, and `kurator-akka.jar` is stored in `~/bin`, the following command will compile your actor to produce `MyActor.class`:\n\n    javac -classpath ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar MyActor.java\n\nNote that including `kurator-akka.jar` on the classpath during compilation is unnecessary if your actor is a POJO, i.e. not a subclass of `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor`.\n\nDeveloping new Python actors\n--------------------------------------\nNew Python actors can be used in **Kurator-Akka** workflows without any manual compilation step. Python actors that depend only on packages provided as part of a standard Python distribution can be developed without any preparation other than downloading the **Kurator-Akka** jar file.  The `kurator-akka.jar` also includes within it all of the 3rd-party Python packages requierd by the basic actors provided in the jar.\n\n\nHowever, if you develop new Python actors that depend on 3rd-party packages not included in the  **Kurator-Akka** jar file, you will need to install these packages to a local **Jython** installation.  Jython is a Java implementation of the Python language and runtime, and comes with the same package management tools as Python, including `pip`.\n\n#### Install the Jython 2.7.1b3 distribution to support 3rd party Python packages\n\n* Download the [Jython 2.7.1.b3 installer jar](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.1b3/jython-installer-2.7.1b3.jar). The downloaded jar file will be named `jython_installer-2.7.1b3.jar`.\n\n* The Jython installer can be started either by double-clicking the downloaded jar file (on Windows or OS X) or executing the downloaded jar at the command prompt using the `java -jar` command:\n\n        java -jar jython_installer-2.7.1b3.jar\n\n* Note the location of the Jython installation directory created by the installer.\n\n#### Install dependencies for native actor support\n\nAs an alternative to the actors that used the Java based Python interpreter Jython, native actor support is provided for embedded Python and R.\n\nOn Linux, install the native dependencies for R and Python via:\n\n    sudo apt-get install r-base python python-dev\n    \nOn MacOS, install the native dependencies via:\n\n    brew install python r\n\n#### Make installed Python packages available to Kurator\n\nDefine the environment variable `JYTHONHOME` to indicate the path to the newly installed Jython 2.7.0 distribution. **Kurator-Akka** uses this variable to locate 3rd-party Python packages that specific actors depend upon.\n\nIn a bash shell the environment variable can be assigned with the following command (assuming, for example, that Jython was installed to the `jython2.7.1b3` directory within your home directory):\n\n    export JYTHONHOME=$HOME/jython2.7.1b3/\n\nOn Windows it is easiest to define the variable using the Advanced system settings Environment Variables dialog:\n\n    Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables\n\n**Kurator-Akka** now will have access to all Python packages installed to your Jython installation.  Jython 2.7 includes the `pip` tool (in the `bin` subdirectory of the Jython installation) which makes it easy to install 3rd-party Python packages and to install their dependencies automatically.  For example, this following command installs the `suds-jurko` package which subsequently can be imported by Python actors:\n\n    $JYTHON_HOME/bin/pip install suds-jurko\n\n#### Make your own Python code available to **Kurator-Akka**\n\nTo make your own Python code available to **Kurator-Akka** specify the directory (or directories) containing your Python packages using the `JYTHONPATH` variable.  For example, if you have defined a Python function `add_two_numbers()` in a file named `adders.py`, and placed this Python module (file) in the `$HOME/packages/math/operators` directory, you can make your function available for use in an actor via the `math.operators.adders` module by defining `JYTHONPATH` to include the `$HOME/packages/` directory and then declaring the `module` and `onData` properties of the actor as follows:  \n\n    types:\n    - id: Adder\n      type: PythonClassActor\n      properties:\n        module: math.operators.adders\n        onData: add_two_numbers\n\nNote that Python packages always require that a file named `__init__.py` be present in each directory comprising the package.  In the above example, the directories `$HOME/packages/math` and `$HOME/packages/math/operators` must each contain a file named `__init__.py`. These files may be empty.\n\nFor native actor support set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the same value.\n\nInstructions for Kurator-Akka workflow engine developers\n---------------------------\nIf you would like to build, modify, or extend the **Kurator-Akka** workflow engine you may set up your development environment as follows.\n\n#### JDK and Maven configuration\n\nThe **Kurator-Akka** framework is built using Maven 3. Before building **Kurator-Akka** confirm that the `mvn` command is in your path, that your version of Maven is at least 3.0.5, and that a JDK version 1.8.0 (or higher) is found by Maven:\n\n    $ mvn --version\n    Apache Maven 3.3.3 (7994120775791599e205a5524ec3e0dfe41d4a06; 2015-04-22T04:57:37-07:00)\n    Maven home: /Users/tmcphill/DropBox/Library/Java/apache-maven-3.3.3\n    Java version: 1.8.0_65, vendor: Oracle Corporation\n    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home/jre\n    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8\n    OS name: \"mac os x\", version: \"10.11.3\", arch: \"x86_64\", family: \"mac\"\n    $\n\nJDK 7 and Maven 3 downloads and detailed installation instructions can be found at the following links:\n\n- [Instructions for installing and configuring JDK 1.8](lhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/) (Oracle Java Documentation)\n- [Instructions for installing and configuring Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Apache Maven Project)\n\n\n#### Project directory layout\n\n**Kurator-Akka** adopts the default organization of source code, resources, and tests as defined by Maven.  See [maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) for more information.  The most important directories are listed below:\n\nDirectory            | Description\n---------------------|-----------\nsrc/main/java        | Source code to be built and packaged for distribution.\nsrc/main/resources   | Resource files to be packaged with production code.\nsrc/test/java        | Source code for unit tests. Not included in packaged distributions.\nsrc/test/resources   | Resource files available to tests. Not included in packaged distributions.\ntarget               | Destination directory for packaged distributions (jar files) built by maven.\ntarget/classes       | Compiled java classes for source code found under src/main/java.\ntarget/test-classes  | Compiled java classes for test code found under src/test/java.\ntarget/dependency    | Automatically resolved and downloaded dependencies (jars) that will be included in the standalone distribution.\ntarget/apidocs/      | Local build of Javadoc documentation.\npackages             | Custom Python packages to be included in the distribution.\n\nNote that the final directory, `packages` contains all of the Python source files developed and delivered with the **Kurator-Akka** engine.  Any new packages added to this directory are automatically made available to **Kurator-Akka**.\n\n\n#### Building and testing with maven\n\n**Kurator-Akka** can be built and tested from the command line using the following commands:\n\nMaven command | Description\n--------------|------------\nmvn clean     | Delete the target directory including all compiled classes.\nmvn compile   | Download required dependencies and compile source code in src/main/java.  Only those source files changes since the last compilation or clean are built.\nmvn test      | Compile the classes in src/test/java and run all tests found therein. Peforms *mvn compile* first.\nmvn package   | Package the compiled classes in target/classes and files found in src/main/resources in two jar files, **kurator-akka-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar** and **kurator-akka-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar**.  The latter also contains all jar dependencies. Performs *mvn compile* and *mvn test* first, and will not perform packaging step if any tests fail. Use the `-DskipTests` option to bypass tests.\nmvn javadoc:javadoc | Build Javadoc documentation. The `mvn package` command also builds Javadoc.\n\n#### Continuous integration with Bamboo\n\nAll code is built and tests run automatically on a build server at NCSA whenever changes are committed to directories used by maven.  Please confirm that the automated build and tests succeed after committing changes to code or resource files (it may take up to two minutes for a commit-triggered build to start).  Functional tests depend on the scripts in src/main/resources and are likely to fail if not updated following changes to these scripts.\n\nSite                  | Url\n----------------------| ---\nBuild history         | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA\nLast build            | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA/latest\nLast successful build | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA/latestSuccessful\n\nThe link to the latest successful build is useful for obtaining the most recently built jar file without building it yourself.

This software toolkit is being developed as part of the [Kurator project](http://wiki.datakurator.net/wiki/Kurator) and is designed to make it easy to develop and run high-performance data cleaning workflows.\n\n**Kurator-Akka** is based on the [Akka actor toolkit and runtime](http://akka.io).  It aims to accelerate development of new data cleaning actors and to facilitate development of new workflows assembled from these actors.  **Kurator-Akka** supports actors implemented either in Java or Python, and the framework shields actor developers from the complexities of using the Akka API directly.  Workflows are specified using a YAML-based language that defines how data flows between the actors at run time.\n\nThe remainder of this README provides simple examples of actors and workflows that employ Kurator-Akka, describes how to run example workflows at the command line, and outlines the setup required to develop with or extend the **Kurator-Akka** source code.  Detailed user documentation will be provided elsewhere.\n\nThe TDWG 2015 presentation [Data cleaning with the Kurator toolkit](http://www.slideshare.net/TimothyMcPhillips/data-cleaning-with-the-kurator-toolkit-bridging-the-gap-between-conventional-scripting-and-highperformance-workflow-automation) provides an overview of the Kurator project and tools described in this README.  Also see the list of publications on the [Kurator project wiki](https://wiki.datakurator.net/wiki/Kurator#Publications).\n\nCiting Kurator-Akka\n-------------------\n\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1068311.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1068311)\n\nObtaining Kurator-Akka\n----------------------\n\nAn executable jar is available in the [current release](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka/releases/latest)\n\nAlso see the [Kurator-Web](http://wiki.datakurator.org/wiki/Kurator-Web_User_Documentation) application for running Kurator-Akka workflows through a web interface.\n\nKurator-Akka is available as a dependency in maven central:\n\n    <dependency>\n       <groupId>org.datakurator</groupId>\n       <artifactId>kurator-akka</artifactId>\n       <version>1.0.1</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nExample actor and workflow\n--------------------------\n\nA *workflow* is a collection of actors configured to carry out some set of tasks.  An *actor* is a software component that receives data either from outside the workflow, or from other actors within the same workflow; and either communicates the results of its computations to other actors, or saves the results outside the running workflow.  Actors in a **Kurator-Akka** workflow run concurrently in different threads.\n\n**Kurator-Akka** simplifies use of the underlying Akka actor framework by providing the `KuratorActor` class as an alternative to Akka's `UntypedActor` class.  A sub-class of `UntypedActor`, `KuratorActor` makes scientific-workflow specific capabilities available to actor and workflow authors, most critically through the `onData()` event handling method.  When Akka triggers events handled by  the `UntypedActor.onRecieve()` method, the `KuratorActor` implementation of `onRecieve()` makes calls to the `onData()` methods defined by Kurator-Akka actors.  **Kurator-Akka** further provides automated means for orchestrating actors in ways compatible with computational pipelines typically used to automate scientific workflows.  For example, **Kurator-Akka** correctly times actor initialization and actor shutdown events so that workflow authors need not concern themselves with these otherwise complex--yet critical--workflow management details.\n\nActors in **Kurator-Akka** may be implemented either in Java or in Python.\n\n\n##### Java implementation of a Multiplier actor\n\nThe Java class below defines a simple actor for multiplying an integer by a configurable constant:\n\n    import org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor;\n\n    public class Multiplier extends KuratorActor {\n        public double factor = 1;\n        @Override public void onData(Object i) {\n        \tbroadcast((double)i * factor);\n        }\n    }\n\nAs shown above, a new Java actor can be implemented by declaring a new Java class that overrides the `onData()` method of the `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor` base class.  This method will be called by the **Kurator-Akka** framework each time the actor receives any data.  The call to `broadcast()` within the `onData()` method sends data (usually the results of performing some computation on the data received by the actor) to any other actors in the workflow configured to listen to this one.\n\nAn alternative approach to defining a **Kurator-Akka** Java actor is to implement the actor as a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) and declare to the Kurator-Akka framework which public method is to be called for each received data object. By default the method named `onData()` will be used. This method must be a function that returns the value to be broadcast to other actors.  A POJO implementation of the above Multiplier actor is as follows:\n\n    public class Multiplier {\n        public double factor = 1;\n        public void multiply(Object i) {\n        \treturn((double)i * factor);\n        }\n    }\n\nNo class inheritance is required when using using the POJO approach.  However, POJO actors have the limitation that only one output data item may be returned and communicated to other actors for each input data item the actor receives.  In contrast, Java actors derived from `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor` may call the `broadcast()` method multiple times within the `onData()` method and so produce multiple outputs per input.\n\nBoth approaches for Java actors support event handlers in addition to `onData()`. These include `onInitialize()`, called before any actor produces output; `onStart()`, which allows actors to produce output data before any input data is received; and `onEnd()`, which is called after an actor has handled the last data item it will receive during a workflow run.\n\n##### Python implementations of the Multiplier actor\n\nAn implementation of the same actor in Python is analogous to the POJO approach above, with the difference that the input data handler can, but does not need to be, defined as a method in a class. Any name may be used for the input data handing function; `on_data()` is assumed by default.\n\nThus, the following Python snippet can serve as a valid actor implementaion:\n\n    factor = 1\n    def multiply(i):\n        return factor * i\n\nAnd methods defined in Python classes work as well:\n\n    class MultiplierActor(object):\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.factor = 1\n        def multiply(i):\n            return self.factor * i\n\n\nAs for POJOs, the **Kurator-Akka** framework can be configured to call the `multiply()` function on each data item received by either of the above implementations of the actor.  The value returned from the function is automatically broadcast to listeners.  Unlike POJO actors, actors implemented as Python functions alternatively may produce a sequence of output data items for each input data item received by using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.\n\nSimilar to Java actors, Python actors may provide `on_initialize()`, `on_start()`, and `on_end()` event handlers (and may name these functions arbitrarily).\n\n##### YAML declaration of a Python implementation of the Multiplier actor\n\nIn addition to the Java or Python definition of an actor, an *actor type declaration* authored in YAML is needed to make the actor available for use in workflows.  The following declares that actors of type `Multiplier`, a subtype of `PythonActor`, invoke the `multiply()` function defined in the file `multiplier.py` to handle incoming data:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        script: multiplier.py\n        onData: multiply\n\nThe argument to the `script:` property is an absolute path to the Python file defining the function, or a path relative to the directory in which the workflow is invoked.  A  less fragile way of defining a Python actor is to make the Python script part of a Python package, and use the `module` property to refer to the script.  For example, if `multiplier.py` is in the `math.operators` package, then the following declaration will work:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        module: math.operators.multiplier\n        onData: multiply\n\nA declaration corresponding to a Python class implementation of the actor defined in a `math.actors` package would be as follows:\n\n    types:\n    - id: Multiplier\n      type: PythonClassActor\n      properties:\n        pythonClass: math.actors.MultiplierActor\n        onData: multiply\n\n\nAnalogous declarations must be provided for Java actors as well.\n\n\n##### Defining a workflow that uses the Multiplier actor\n\nWith either of the above YAML snippets saved to a file named `actors.yaml`, the Python-based `Multiplier` actor can be used in a workflow also defined in YAML. The workflow below accepts an input value from the user, multiplies it by 3, and outputs the result:\n\n    imports:\n\n    - file:actors.yaml\n\n    components:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThreeWorkflow\n      type: Workflow\n      properties:\n        actors:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n          - !ref MultiplyByThree\n          - !ref PrintProduct\n\n    - id: ReadOneNumber\n      type: NumReader\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: Multiplier\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        parameters:\n          factor: 3\n\n    - id: PrintProduct\n      type: NumPrinter\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref MultiplyByThree\n\nThe above declaration states the following: `MultiplyByThreeWorkflow` is a workflow comprising three actors, `ReadOneNumber`, `MultiplyByThree`, and `PrintProduct`. `MultiplyByThree` listens to (receives its input from) `ReadOneNumber`, and `PrintProduct` receives its input in turn from `MultiplyByThree`.  `MultiplyByThree` is declared to be an instance of the `Multiplier` actor type defined previously; this instance of `Multiplier` is configured to multiply each value it receives by a factor of 3.  The YAML declarations for the underlying actor types `NumReader`, `Multiplier`, and `NumPrinter` are all imported from `actors.yaml`.\n\nThe YAML definition of a workflow using Java implementations of each actor looks identical to a workflow using Python actors.  Java actors and Python actors can be used together in the same workflow.\n\n##### Inlining Python actors\n\n**Kurator-Akka** allows the code for Python actors to be provided *inline*, i.e. within the workflow definition itself. No additional Python script file or YAML actor type declaration is needed in this case (the type of the actor is simply `PythonActor`).  For example, the block of YAML defining the `MultiplyByThree` actor in the workflow definition above depends on an additional YAML declaration for the `Multiplier` actor defined in the `actors.yaml` file, which in turn depends on a Python script file named `multiplier.py`.  Because the code for this actor is only a few lines long, it may be reasonable to define the actor entirely inline.  In other words, this block of YAML in the workflow:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: Multiplier\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        parameters:\n          factor: 3\n\ncan be replaced with:\n\n    - id: MultiplyByThree\n      type: PythonActor\n      properties:\n        listensTo:\n          - !ref ReadOneNumber\n        onData: triple\n        code: |\n          def triple(n):\n            return 3 * n\n\nThe Python code defining the `multiply()` function is now defined within the same YAML file that declares the workflow as a whole. Inlined Python actors are useful for implementing simple actors needed for specific workflows.\n\n\nPreparing to run Kurator-Akka\n-----------------------------\n\nThis section describes how to set up an environment for writing your own actors and workflows, and executing them using **Kurator-Akka**. Instructions for building and extending the **Kurator-Akka** framework itself are provided following this section.\n\n#### Check installed version of Java\n**Kurator-Akka** requires Java version 1.8.0 or higher. To determine the version of java installed on your computer use the `-version` option to the `java` command. For example,\n\n    $ java -version\n    java version \"1.8.0_65\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)\n\n\nInstructions for installing Java may be found at [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html).  If you plan to develop new actors in Java (not just in Python) be sure to install the JDK.  Otherwise a JRE is sufficient.\n\n#### Download the Kurator-Akka jar\n\n**Kurator-Akka** is distributed as an executable jar (Java archive) file that can be invoked using the `java -jar` command. To download the most recent build of the latest **Kurator-Akka** code, navigate to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka/releases/latest) and click on the `kurator-akka-1.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar` link under the *Assets* tab to download the *executable jar* artifact for the *kurator-akka* job.\n\n#### Install Kurator-Akka on your system\n\nOnce you have downloaded the **Kurator-Akka** jar, save the file in a convenient location and rename it to something like `kurator-akka.jar`.   **Kurator-Akka** can now be run using the `java -jar` command. The jar file includes several sample workflow scripts which can be accessed from the command line.\n\nTest your installation by running the `hello.yaml` workflow. Assuming `kurator-akka.jar` is in your current working directory type:\n\n    java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n\nIf the Kurator-Akka jar is stored elsewhere, qualify `kurator-akka.jar` with the path to that file. For example, if you stored the jar file in the bin subdirectory of your home directory, running Kurator-Akka would look something like this on Linux or OS X:\n\n    $ java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nOn Windows platforms the command is similar:\n\n    $ java -jar %USERPROFILE%\\bin\\kurator-akka.jar -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\n#### Define a short command for running Kurator-Akka at the prompt\n\nIf you are running **Kurator-Akka** on an Apple OSX or Linux system (or use Git Bash or Cygwin on Windows), you may define an *alias* to simplify running **Kurator-Akka** at the command line. On Windows platforms you similarly may define a *doskey macro* for running **Kurator-Akka** at the prompt.\n\nFor example, if you have saved `kurator-akka.jar` to the bin subdirectory of your home directory, the following command will create a `bash` alias for running **Kurator-Akka** simply by typing `ka`:\n\n    alias ka='java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar'\n\nIf you use `csh` or `tcsh` the command is:\n\n    alias kurator-akka java -jar ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar\n\nOn Windows the command to create the `ka` doskey macro is:\n\n     doskey ka=java -jar %USERPROFILE%\\bin\\kurator-akka.jar $*\n\nOn all platforms the `hello.yaml` demo now can be run using the short command:\n\n    $ ka -f classpath:/org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\n#### Extract and run sample workflows (optional)\n\nIf you would like to browse and edit the sample workflows included in the **Kurator-Akka** jar, type the following (qualifying the path to `kurator-akka.jar` as necessary) to extract its contents to your filesystem:\n\n    jar xf kurator-akka.jar org/kurator/akka/samples\n\nTo run a script residing on the filesystem, you can use the `file:` qualifier instead of `classpath:`:\n\n    $ java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f file:org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nThe `file:` qualifier is optional, however. By default **Kurator-Akka** looks for workflows on your filesystem. So this will work, too:\n\n\n    $ java -jar kurator-akka.jar -f org/kurator/akka/samples/hello.yaml\n    Hello World!\n\nNote that the path to `hello.yaml` above is relative (it does not start with a `/`).\n\n\nDeveloping new Java actors\n-------------------------------\nNew Java actors can be implemented using standard Java development tools.  Simply make sure that the `kurator-akka.jar` file is on the CLASSPATH when compiling your actors, and that the compiled `.class` files are on the CLASSPATH when running **Kurator-Akka**.\n\nFor example, if your new actor is defined in the file `MyActor.java`, and `kurator-akka.jar` is stored in `~/bin`, the following command will compile your actor to produce `MyActor.class`:\n\n    javac -classpath ~/bin/kurator-akka.jar MyActor.java\n\nNote that including `kurator-akka.jar` on the classpath during compilation is unnecessary if your actor is a POJO, i.e. not a subclass of `org.kurator.akka.KuratorActor`.\n\nDeveloping new Python actors\n--------------------------------------\nNew Python actors can be used in **Kurator-Akka** workflows without any manual compilation step. Python actors that depend only on packages provided as part of a standard Python distribution can be developed without any preparation other than downloading the **Kurator-Akka** jar file.  The `kurator-akka.jar` also includes within it all of the 3rd-party Python packages requierd by the basic actors provided in the jar.\n\n\nHowever, if you develop new Python actors that depend on 3rd-party packages not included in the  **Kurator-Akka** jar file, you will need to install these packages to a local **Jython** installation.  Jython is a Java implementation of the Python language and runtime, and comes with the same package management tools as Python, including `pip`.\n\n#### Install the Jython 2.7.1b3 distribution to support 3rd party Python packages\n\n* Download the [Jython 2.7.1.b3 installer jar](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.1b3/jython-installer-2.7.1b3.jar). The downloaded jar file will be named `jython_installer-2.7.1b3.jar`.\n\n* The Jython installer can be started either by double-clicking the downloaded jar file (on Windows or OS X) or executing the downloaded jar at the command prompt using the `java -jar` command:\n\n        java -jar jython_installer-2.7.1b3.jar\n\n* Note the location of the Jython installation directory created by the installer.\n\n#### Install dependencies for native actor support\n\nAs an alternative to the actors that used the Java based Python interpreter Jython, native actor support is provided for embedded Python and R.\n\nOn Linux, install the native dependencies for R and Python via:\n\n    sudo apt-get install r-base python python-dev\n    \nOn MacOS, install the native dependencies via:\n\n    brew install python r\n\n#### Make installed Python packages available to Kurator\n\nDefine the environment variable `JYTHONHOME` to indicate the path to the newly installed Jython 2.7.0 distribution. **Kurator-Akka** uses this variable to locate 3rd-party Python packages that specific actors depend upon.\n\nIn a bash shell the environment variable can be assigned with the following command (assuming, for example, that Jython was installed to the `jython2.7.1b3` directory within your home directory):\n\n    export JYTHONHOME=$HOME/jython2.7.1b3/\n\nOn Windows it is easiest to define the variable using the Advanced system settings Environment Variables dialog:\n\n    Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables\n\n**Kurator-Akka** now will have access to all Python packages installed to your Jython installation.  Jython 2.7 includes the `pip` tool (in the `bin` subdirectory of the Jython installation) which makes it easy to install 3rd-party Python packages and to install their dependencies automatically.  For example, this following command installs the `suds-jurko` package which subsequently can be imported by Python actors:\n\n    $JYTHON_HOME/bin/pip install suds-jurko\n\n#### Make your own Python code available to **Kurator-Akka**\n\nTo make your own Python code available to **Kurator-Akka** specify the directory (or directories) containing your Python packages using the `JYTHONPATH` variable.  For example, if you have defined a Python function `add_two_numbers()` in a file named `adders.py`, and placed this Python module (file) in the `$HOME/packages/math/operators` directory, you can make your function available for use in an actor via the `math.operators.adders` module by defining `JYTHONPATH` to include the `$HOME/packages/` directory and then declaring the `module` and `onData` properties of the actor as follows:  \n\n    types:\n    - id: Adder\n      type: PythonClassActor\n      properties:\n        module: math.operators.adders\n        onData: add_two_numbers\n\nNote that Python packages always require that a file named `__init__.py` be present in each directory comprising the package.  In the above example, the directories `$HOME/packages/math` and `$HOME/packages/math/operators` must each contain a file named `__init__.py`. These files may be empty.\n\nFor native actor support set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the same value.\n\nInstructions for Kurator-Akka workflow engine developers\n---------------------------\nIf you would like to build, modify, or extend the **Kurator-Akka** workflow engine you may set up your development environment as follows.\n\n#### JDK and Maven configuration\n\nThe **Kurator-Akka** framework is built using Maven 3. Before building **Kurator-Akka** confirm that the `mvn` command is in your path, that your version of Maven is at least 3.0.5, and that a JDK version 1.8.0 (or higher) is found by Maven:\n\n    $ mvn --version\n    Apache Maven 3.3.3 (7994120775791599e205a5524ec3e0dfe41d4a06; 2015-04-22T04:57:37-07:00)\n    Maven home: /Users/tmcphill/DropBox/Library/Java/apache-maven-3.3.3\n    Java version: 1.8.0_65, vendor: Oracle Corporation\n    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home/jre\n    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8\n    OS name: \"mac os x\", version: \"10.11.3\", arch: \"x86_64\", family: \"mac\"\n    $\n\nJDK 7 and Maven 3 downloads and detailed installation instructions can be found at the following links:\n\n- [Instructions for installing and configuring JDK 1.8](lhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/) (Oracle Java Documentation)\n- [Instructions for installing and configuring Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Apache Maven Project)\n\n\n#### Project directory layout\n\n**Kurator-Akka** adopts the default organization of source code, resources, and tests as defined by Maven.  See [maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) for more information.  The most important directories are listed below:\n\nDirectory            | Description\n---------------------|-----------\nsrc/main/java        | Source code to be built and packaged for distribution.\nsrc/main/resources   | Resource files to be packaged with production code.\nsrc/test/java        | Source code for unit tests. Not included in packaged distributions.\nsrc/test/resources   | Resource files available to tests. Not included in packaged distributions.\ntarget               | Destination directory for packaged distributions (jar files) built by maven.\ntarget/classes       | Compiled java classes for source code found under src/main/java.\ntarget/test-classes  | Compiled java classes for test code found under src/test/java.\ntarget/dependency    | Automatically resolved and downloaded dependencies (jars) that will be included in the standalone distribution.\ntarget/apidocs/      | Local build of Javadoc documentation.\npackages             | Custom Python packages to be included in the distribution.\n\nNote that the final directory, `packages` contains all of the Python source files developed and delivered with the **Kurator-Akka** engine.  Any new packages added to this directory are automatically made available to **Kurator-Akka**.\n\n\n#### Building and testing with maven\n\n**Kurator-Akka** can be built and tested from the command line using the following commands:\n\nMaven command | Description\n--------------|------------\nmvn clean     | Delete the target directory including all compiled classes.\nmvn compile   | Download required dependencies and compile source code in src/main/java.  Only those source files changes since the last compilation or clean are built.\nmvn test      | Compile the classes in src/test/java and run all tests found therein. Peforms *mvn compile* first.\nmvn package   | Package the compiled classes in target/classes and files found in src/main/resources in two jar files, **kurator-akka-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar** and **kurator-akka-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar**.  The latter also contains all jar dependencies. Performs *mvn compile* and *mvn test* first, and will not perform packaging step if any tests fail. Use the `-DskipTests` option to bypass tests.\nmvn javadoc:javadoc | Build Javadoc documentation. The `mvn package` command also builds Javadoc.\n\n#### Continuous integration with Bamboo\n\nAll code is built and tests run automatically on a build server at NCSA whenever changes are committed to directories used by maven.  Please confirm that the automated build and tests succeed after committing changes to code or resource files (it may take up to two minutes for a commit-triggered build to start).  Functional tests depend on the scripts in src/main/resources and are likely to fail if not updated following changes to these scripts.\n\nSite                  | Url\n----------------------| ---\nBuild history         | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA\nLast build            | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA/latest\nLast successful build | https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA/latestSuccessful\n\nThe link to the latest successful build is useful for obtaining the most recently built jar file without building it yourself.  Follow the link to the [last successful build](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bamboo/browse/KURATOR-AKKA \"last successful build\"), click the Artifacts tab, then download the executable jar.\n\n#### Maintainer deployment: \n\nTo deploy a snapshot to the snapshotRepository:\n\n    mvn clean deploy\n\nTo deploy a new release to maven central, set the version in pom.xml to a non-snapshot version, then deploy with the release profile (which adds package signing and deployment to release staging:\n\n    mvn clean deploy -P release\n\nAfter this, you will need to login to the sonatype oss repository hosting nexus instance, find the staged release in the staging repositories, and perform the release.  It should be possible (haven't verified this yet) to perform the release from the command line instead by running:\n\n    mvn nexus-staging:release -P release\n    \n<!---\n\nDevelopment for Kurator-Akka\n----------------------------\n\nTODO: Documentation of development for framework, and for included Java actors.\n\nTODO: Including Java libraries of actors\n\nTo make a Java class file available as a core Kurator-Akka actor that can be invoked\nfrom Kurator-Akka using a yaml workflow declaration, you will need to:  \n\n(1) Create a java class (which either contains the desired functionality or wraps it),\nwhich extends KuratorActor.\n\n(2) Add a type definition block to src/main/resources/org/kurator/akka/types.yaml\ngiving an ID for the actor, and the classpath for the actor.\n\n(3) Invoke the actor by ID in a workflow defined in a yaml file.\n\n--->\n"}, "mchancan/flynet": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "mchancan/flynet", "diskUsage": 4267, "name": "flynet", "owner": {"login": "mchancan"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-02-20T07:47:56Z", "pushedAt": "2020-03-19T13:18:09Z", "object": {"text": "# A Hybrid Compact Neural Architecture for Visual Place Recognition\n\nIn this release, we provide an open source implementation of the FlyNet supervised learning experiments in [**A Hybrid Compact Neural Architecture for Visual Place Recognition**](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324), published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal (DOI [10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324)).

for Visual Place Recognition\n\nIn this release, we provide an open source implementation of the FlyNet supervised learning experiments in [**A Hybrid Compact Neural Architecture for Visual Place Recognition**](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2967324), published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal (DOI

The parts are:\n\n* DOIBot, found in index.html (web frontend) and process_page.php (information is\n  POSTed to this and it does the citation expansion; backend). This automatically\n  posts a new page revision with expanded citations and thus requires a bot account.\n  All activity takes place on Tool Labs.\n* Citation expander (:en:Mediawiki:Gadget-citations.js) + gadgetapi.php. This\n  is comprises an Ajax front-end in the on-wiki gadget and a PHP backend API.\n* [Generate template](https://github.com/ms609/citation-bot/blob/master/generate_template.php) creates the wiki reference given an identifier (for example given a doi: <https://tools.wmflabs.org/citations/generate_template.php?doi=10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648183>)\n\nBugs and requested changes are listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Citation_bot .\n\n## Structure\n\nBasic structure of a Citation bot script:\n* define configuration constants\n* require `setup.php`, which will set up the rest of the needed functions\n* use Page functions to fetch/expand/post the page's text\n\n\nA quick tour of the main files:\n* `constants.php`: constants defined\n* `WikipediaBot.php`: functions to facilitate HTTP access to the Wikipedia API.\n* `NameTools.php`: defines name functions\n* `setup.php`: sets up needed functions, requires most of the other files listed here\n* `expandFns.php`: a variety of functions\n* `apiFunctions.php`: sets up needed functions for expanding pmid/doi/etc\n\nClass files:\n* `Page.php`: Represents an individual page to expand citations on. Key methods are\n  `Page::get_text_from()`, `Page::expand_text()`, and `Page::write()`.\n* `Template.php`: most of the actual expansion happens here.\n  `Template::add_if_new()` is generally (but not always) used to add\n   parameters to the updated template; `Template::tidy()` cleans up the\n   template, but may add parameters as well and have side effects.\n* `Comment.php`: Handles comments, nokwiki, etc. tags\n* `Parameter.php`: contains information about template parameter names, values,\n   and metadata, and methods to parse template parameters.\n\n## Style and structure notes\n\nConstants and definitions should be provided in `constants.php`.\nClasses should be in individual files. The code is generally written densely. \nBeware assignments in conditionals, one-line `if`/`foreach`/`else` statements, \nand action taking place through method calls that take place in assignments or equality checks. \nAlso beware the difference between `else if` and `elseif`.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe bot requires PHP >= 5.6.\n\nTo run the bot from a new environment, you will need to create an `env.php` file (if one doesn't already exist) that sets the needed authentication tokens as environment variables. To do this, you can rename `env.php.example` to `env.php`, set the variables in the file, and then make sure the file is not world readable or writable:\n\n    chmod o-rwx env.php\n\n To run the bot as a webservice from WMF Tool Forge:\n\n    become citations[-dev]\n    webservice stop\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes start\n\nOr for testing in the shell:\n\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes shell\n\nBefore entering the k8s shell, it may be necessary to install phpunit \n(as wget is not available in the k8s shell):\n\n    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-5.phar\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes shell\n    php phpunit-5.phar tests/phpunit/TemplateTest.php\n\n\n## Dependency services\n\nThe bot accesses an instance of the Zotero translation server.  The source code for this server is https://github.com/ms609/translation-server\n\nThis can be updated by maintainers logging on to Toolforge, then entering the commands \n\n    become translation-server\n    npm update\n    webservice restart\n    \n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 5825, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor":

**master** code is implemented at https://tools.wmflabs.org/citations/, and is intended for public use.\n- When needed, the **development** branch is intended for major restructuring and testing, and is implemented at https://tools.wmflabs.org/citations-dev/ .  \n\n## Overview\n\nThis is some basic documentation about what this bot is and how some of the parts connect.\n\nThis is more properly a bot-gadget-tool combination. The parts are:\n\n* DOIBot, found in index.html (web frontend) and process_page.php (information is\n  POSTed to this and it does the citation expansion; backend). This automatically\n  posts a new page revision with expanded citations and thus requires a bot account.\n  All activity takes place on Tool Labs.\n* Citation expander (:en:Mediawiki:Gadget-citations.js) + gadgetapi.php. This\n  is comprises an Ajax front-end in the on-wiki gadget and a PHP backend API.\n* [Generate template](https://github.com/ms609/citation-bot/blob/master/generate_template.php) creates the wiki reference given an identifier (for example given a doi: <https://tools.wmflabs.org/citations/generate_template.php?doi=10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648183>)\n\nBugs and requested changes are listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Citation_bot .\n\n## Structure\n\nBasic structure of a Citation bot script:\n* define configuration constants\n* require `setup.php`, which will set up the rest of the needed functions\n* use Page functions to fetch/expand/post the page's text\n\n\nA quick tour of the main files:\n* `constants.php`: constants defined\n* `WikipediaBot.php`: functions to facilitate HTTP access to the Wikipedia API.\n* `NameTools.php`: defines name functions\n* `setup.php`: sets up needed functions, requires most of the other files listed here\n* `expandFns.php`: a variety of functions\n* `apiFunctions.php`: sets up needed functions for expanding pmid/doi/etc\n\nClass files:\n* `Page.php`: Represents an individual page to expand citations on. Key methods are\n  `Page::get_text_from()`, `Page::expand_text()`, and `Page::write()`.\n* `Template.php`: most of the actual expansion happens here.\n  `Template::add_if_new()` is generally (but not always) used to add\n   parameters to the updated template; `Template::tidy()` cleans up the\n   template, but may add parameters as well and have side effects.\n* `Comment.php`: Handles comments, nokwiki, etc. tags\n* `Parameter.php`: contains information about template parameter names, values,\n   and metadata, and methods to parse template parameters.\n\n## Style and structure notes\n\nConstants and definitions should be provided in `constants.php`.\nClasses should be in individual files. The code is generally written densely. \nBeware assignments in conditionals, one-line `if`/`foreach`/`else` statements, \nand action taking place through method calls that take place in assignments or equality checks. \nAlso beware the difference between `else if` and `elseif`.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe bot requires PHP >= 5.6.\n\nTo run the bot from a new environment, you will need to create an `env.php` file (if one doesn't already exist) that sets the needed authentication tokens as environment variables. To do this, you can rename `env.php.example` to `env.php`, set the variables in the file, and then make sure the file is not world readable or writable:\n\n    chmod o-rwx env.php\n\n To run the bot as a webservice from WMF Tool Forge:\n\n    become citations[-dev]\n    webservice stop\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes start\n\nOr for testing in the shell:\n\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes shell\n\nBefore entering the k8s shell, it may be necessary to install phpunit \n(as wget is not available in the k8s shell):\n\n    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-5.phar\n    webservice --backend=kubernetes shell\n    php phpunit-5.phar tests/phpunit/TemplateTest.php\n\n\n## Dependency services\n\nThe bot accesses an instance of the Zotero translation server.  The source code for this server is https://github.com/ms609/translation-server\n\nThis can be updated by maintainers logging on to Toolforge, then entering the commands \n\n    become translation-server\n    npm update\n    webservice restart\n    \n"}, "psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav", "diskUsage": 11697, "name": "paper-remodnav", "owner": {"login": "psychoinformatics-de"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "TeX"}, {"name": "Makefile"}, {"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-04-02T15:09:46Z", "pushedAt": "2020-03-18T09:19:56Z", "object": {"text": "# REMoDNaV: Robust Eye Movement Detection for Natural Viewing\n\nThis repository contains the raw data, the code to generate summary statistics, and raw figures for the manuscript, and the manuscript sources for the publication [REMoDNaV: Robust Eye Movement Detection for Natural Viewing](yettolink).\n\n## Manuscript\n\nTo recompute results and compile the paper, do the following:\n\n[Optional] create a virtual environment:\n\n    # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)\n    virtualenv --python=python3 ~/env/remodnav\n    . ~/env/remodnav/bin/activate\n    \n- if you haven't yet, install [``remodnav``](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/remodnav), ``seaborn``, and\n [``datalad``](https://www.datalad.org).

Running `./ANALYSIS.sh` is sufficient to reproduce\nthe results in the paper. To use PathCORE-T in your own analyses, please\nreview the sections from\n[The PathCORE-T analysis workflow](#the-pathcore-analysis-workflow) onwards in\nthis README.\n\nWe released two Python packages for PathCORE-T:\n- [PathCORE-T](https://github.com/greenelab/PathCORE-T)\n- [crosstalk-correction](https://github.com/kathyxchen/crosstalk-correction): listed as a dependency in PathCORE-T\n\nThe two packages are used in this analysis repository. \n\n## The [data](data) directory\nA README is provided in the `./data` directory with details about the scripts\nto download and/or process datasets, data source citations, etc.\n\n## The [figures](figures) directory\nAll figures in the PathCORE-T paper are also available here.\n\n## The [jupyter-notebooks](jupyter-notebooks) directory\nScripts used to generate Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 2 are provided\nin notebook format. We have found that we can offer greater detail about\neach of the figures in this format.\n\n### Tutorials\nThis directory also contains 2 notebooks that users can read through or run\nwhen they are getting started with PathCORE-T analysis:\n- [FastICA-based PAO1 KEGG example](jupyter-notebooks/Supplemental_PAO1_FastICA_example.ipynb)\n- [_k_=24 NMF-based TCGA PID example](jupyter-notebooks/Supplemental3_TCGA_NMF_k=24.ipynb)\n\n## The PathCORE-T analysis workflow\nPlease review one of the `analysis_<dataset>_<model>.sh` scripts for an example\nof the workflow.\n\nIn the figure below, **(a)** is used to generate the weight matrix and **(b)**\nspecifies the inputs to the PathCORE-T analysis in **(c)**:\n\n![PathCORE-T analysis workflow diagram](figures/Figure4.PNG?raw=true)\n\n### Scripts (in order of execution):\n1. [run_network_creation.py](run_network_creation.py)\n\n   Iterates through a directory of weight matrices generated by a feature\n   construction algorithm that has been applied to a transcriptomic dataset.\n   Multiple weight matrices can be constructed from the same algorithm\n   initialized with different random seeds. The eADAGE example uses multiple\n   weight matrices, whereas the two NMF examples only use one weight matrix.\n\n2. [run_permutation_test.py](run_permutation_test.py)\n\n   Iterates through a directory of network files and applies a permutation\n   test to the networks to determine edge significance.\n   If there is more than 1 network file in the directory,\n   the networks are combined to make a single aggregate network.\n   Edges that are significant under their corresponding nulls\n   (generated by the permutation test) are kept in the final\n   network.\n\n### Additional:\n- [constants](constants)\n  directory\n\n   This module allows for import of two dictionaries:\n   `GENE_SIGNATURE_DEFINITIONS` and `SHORTEN_PATHWAY_NAMES`.\n   These are intended to be modified when you need to run\n   PathCORE-T using a feature construction algorithm and/or\n   pathway definitions different from those in our case studies.\n\n   In most cases, the files in `constants` should be the only\n   ones you may need to modify to run an analysis of your own.\n\n- [utils.py](utils.py)\n\n   Utility functions for file reading & processing.\n\n## Web application database setup\nHere we describe the steps taken to prepare the database that backs the\n[PathCORE-T demo application](https://pathcore-demo.herokuapp.com/).\nThe demo application is built on the\n[Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and deployed on\n[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The database is a MongoDB instance\nhosted on [mLab](https://mlab.com/).\n\nBoth [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) and\n[mLab](https://mlab.com/plans/pricing/) provide free tier options for their\nservices.\n\nNote that the `--metadata` flag is used in\n[analysis_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh](analysis_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh)\nfor `run_network_creation.py` ahead of the web application setup\ncarried out by running [web_db_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh](web_db_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh).\n\n### Scripts (in order of execution):\n- [web_initialize_db.py](web_initialize_db.py)\n\n   Creates the following collections:\n   - genes: Stores the gene identifiers. Assumes these can be retrieved from\n     the first column (the row names/index) of the transcriptomic dataset.\n     For the PAO1 example, we provided an additional file (for more\n     information, see `data/README.md`) that has the common names corresponding\n     to the gene locus tags specified in the compendium.\n\n   - pathways: Stores the pathway & definition information from the pathway\n     definitions file.\n\n   - sample_labels: Stores the sample labels and the corresponding normalized\n     expression values. Assumes the labels can be retrieved from the first row\n     (the header) of the transcriptomic dataset and each column is the vector\n     of expression values corresponding to that sample.\n     \n   - network_edges: Stores the network files in the `networks` directory\n     created by running `run_network_creation.py`.\n\n   - network_feature_signatures: Stores the feature gene signature information\n     in the `metadata` directory created by running\n     `run_network_creation.py ... --metadata`\n\n   - network_feature_pathways: Stores the feature pathway definitions\n     in the `metadata` directory created by running\n     `run_network_creation.py ... --metadata`\n\n   - sample_annotations: Specific to the PAO1 example, we store additional\n     information about the samples in the compendium that can be displayed\n     on the web application (for more information\n     about the sample annotations file, see `data/README.md).\n\n- [web_edge_page_data.py](web_edge_page_data.py)\n\n   Creates the collection `pathcore_edge_data`. All information needed in\n   an edge page is stored here (e.g. computes gene odds ratios, sample\n   \"summary\" expression scores, creates heatmaps based on these values).\n\n### Additional:\n- [utils_setup_PAO1_example.py](utils_setup_PAO1_example.py)\n\n   Utility files in support of the PAO1 example. Gets the gene common names\n   and sample annotations information.\n\n## PathCORE-T web application setup\n\n### Step 1: mLab setup\n- Register for an mLab account at mLab.com.\n- *Create new*: Create a free sandbox database (0.5 GB).\n- Database *Users* tab: Add a user to the new database that has write-access.\n- Create a credentials file (see [example-mLab-credentials.yml](example-mLab-credentials.yml))\n\n### Step 2: Run `web_initialize_db.py`\n\n### Step 3: Run `web_edge_page_data.py`\n\n### Step 4: The [PathCORE-T-demo source code](https://github.com/kathyxchen/PathCORE-T-demo)\nFork the PathCORE-T-demo repository. Follow the setup instructions in the\nrepository's README. Update or remove any text or code specific to the\neADAGE-based, KEGG PAO1 case study so that the web application accurately\ndescribes and supports your analysis.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history":

described in the\nPathCORE-T paper. Running `./ANALYSIS.sh` is sufficient to reproduce\nthe results in the paper. To use PathCORE-T in your own analyses, please\nreview the sections from\n[The PathCORE-T analysis workflow](#the-pathcore-analysis-workflow) onwards in\nthis README.\n\nWe released two Python packages for PathCORE-T:\n- [PathCORE-T](https://github.com/greenelab/PathCORE-T)\n- [crosstalk-correction](https://github.com/kathyxchen/crosstalk-correction): listed as a dependency in PathCORE-T\n\nThe two packages are used in this analysis repository. \n\n## The [data](data) directory\nA README is provided in the `./data` directory with details about the scripts\nto download and/or process datasets, data source citations, etc.\n\n## The [figures](figures) directory\nAll figures in the PathCORE-T paper are also available here.\n\n## The [jupyter-notebooks](jupyter-notebooks) directory\nScripts used to generate Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 2 are provided\nin notebook format. We have found that we can offer greater detail about\neach of the figures in this format.\n\n### Tutorials\nThis directory also contains 2 notebooks that users can read through or run\nwhen they are getting started with PathCORE-T analysis:\n- [FastICA-based PAO1 KEGG example](jupyter-notebooks/Supplemental_PAO1_FastICA_example.ipynb)\n- [_k_=24 NMF-based TCGA PID example](jupyter-notebooks/Supplemental3_TCGA_NMF_k=24.ipynb)\n\n## The PathCORE-T analysis workflow\nPlease review one of the `analysis_<dataset>_<model>.sh` scripts for an example\nof the workflow.\n\nIn the figure below, **(a)** is used to generate the weight matrix and **(b)**\nspecifies the inputs to the PathCORE-T analysis in **(c)**:\n\n![PathCORE-T analysis workflow diagram](figures/Figure4.PNG?raw=true)\n\n### Scripts (in order of execution):\n1. [run_network_creation.py](run_network_creation.py)\n\n   Iterates through a directory of weight matrices generated by a feature\n   construction algorithm that has been applied to a transcriptomic dataset.\n   Multiple weight matrices can be constructed from the same algorithm\n   initialized with different random seeds. The eADAGE example uses multiple\n   weight matrices, whereas the two NMF examples only use one weight matrix.\n\n2. [run_permutation_test.py](run_permutation_test.py)\n\n   Iterates through a directory of network files and applies a permutation\n   test to the networks to determine edge significance.\n   If there is more than 1 network file in the directory,\n   the networks are combined to make a single aggregate network.\n   Edges that are significant under their corresponding nulls\n   (generated by the permutation test) are kept in the final\n   network.\n\n### Additional:\n- [constants](constants)\n  directory\n\n   This module allows for import of two dictionaries:\n   `GENE_SIGNATURE_DEFINITIONS` and `SHORTEN_PATHWAY_NAMES`.\n   These are intended to be modified when you need to run\n   PathCORE-T using a feature construction algorithm and/or\n   pathway definitions different from those in our case studies.\n\n   In most cases, the files in `constants` should be the only\n   ones you may need to modify to run an analysis of your own.\n\n- [utils.py](utils.py)\n\n   Utility functions for file reading & processing.\n\n## Web application database setup\nHere we describe the steps taken to prepare the database that backs the\n[PathCORE-T demo application](https://pathcore-demo.herokuapp.com/).\nThe demo application is built on the\n[Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and deployed on\n[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The database is a MongoDB instance\nhosted on [mLab](https://mlab.com/).\n\nBoth [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) and\n[mLab](https://mlab.com/plans/pricing/) provide free tier options for their\nservices.\n\nNote that the `--metadata` flag is used in\n[analysis_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh](analysis_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh)\nfor `run_network_creation.py` ahead of the web application setup\ncarried out by running [web_db_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh](web_db_Paeruginosa_eADAGE.sh).\n\n### Scripts (in order of execution):\n- [web_initialize_db.py](web_initialize_db.py)\n\n   Creates the following collections:\n   - genes: Stores the gene identifiers. Assumes these can be retrieved from\n     the first column (the row names/index) of the transcriptomic dataset.\n     For the PAO1 example, we provided an additional file (for more\n     information, see `data/README.md`) that has the common names corresponding\n     to the gene locus tags specified in the compendium.\n\n   - pathways: Stores the pathway & definition information from the pathway\n     definitions file.\n\n   - sample_labels: Stores the sample labels and the corresponding normalized\n     expression values. Assumes the labels can be retrieved from the first row\n     (the header) of the transcriptomic dataset and each column is the vector\n     of expression values corresponding to that sample.\n     \n   - network_edges: Stores the network files in the `networks` directory\n     created by running `run_network_creation.py`.\n\n   - network_feature_signatures: Stores the feature gene signature information\n     in the `metadata` directory created by running\n     `run_network_creation.py ... --metadata`\n\n   - network_feature_pathways: Stores the feature pathway definitions\n     in the `metadata` directory created by running\n     `run_network_creation.py ... --metadata`\n\n   - sample_annotations: Specific to the PAO1 example, we store additional\n     information about the samples in the compendium that can be displayed\n     on the web application (for more information\n     about the sample annotations file, see `data/README.md).\n\n- [web_edge_page_data.py](web_edge_page_data.py)\n\n   Creates the collection `pathcore_edge_data`. All information needed in\n   an edge page is stored here (e.g. computes gene odds ratios, sample\n   \"summary\" expression scores, creates heatmaps based on these values).\n\n### Additional:\n- [utils_setup_PAO1_example.py](utils_setup_PAO1_example.py)\n\n   Utility files in support of the PAO1 example. Gets the gene common names\n   and sample annotations information.\n\n## PathCORE-T web application setup\n\n### Step 1: mLab setup\n- Register for an mLab account at mLab.com.\n- *Create new*: Create a free sandbox database (0.5 GB).\n- Database *Users* tab: Add a user to the new database that has write-access.\n- Create a credentials file (see [example-mLab-credentials.yml](example-mLab-credentials.yml))\n\n### Step 2: Run `web_initialize_db.py`\n\n### Step 3: Run `web_edge_page_data.py`\n\n### Step 4: The [PathCORE-T-demo source code](https://github.com/kathyxchen/PathCORE-T-demo)\nFork the PathCORE-T-demo repository. Follow the setup instructions in the\nrepository's README. Update or remove any text or code specific to the\neADAGE-based, KEGG PAO1 case study so that the web application accurately\ndescribes and supports your analysis.\n"}, "habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills":

the gills of trained and untrained zebrafishes.\nThe [analysis notebook](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/blob/master/Gills-Analysis.ipynb) was used to read all the raw data and to procuce all figures in the manuscript.\n\nThe tomographic datasets of the delineated fish gills which we used for the analyis can be downloaded on [OSF](https://cos.io/our-products/osf/) here: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A5ESX\nThis should enable you to get exactly the same results as we did, e.g. do some [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).\n\nPlease get in touch with me if you cannot repeat the analysis with this data, I'm happy to help!\nYou can either send me an [email](https://www.anatomie.unibe.ch/haberthu), [file an issue](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/issues) or use the 'chat on Gitter' badge on top to start a chat.\n"}, "ref": {"target":

analysis for the manuscript on the *Adaptation Mechanism Of The Adult Zebrafish Respiratory Organ To Endurance Training*.\nA preprint of the manuscript can be found on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/744300v4) with the [doi:10.1101/744300](https://doi.org/10.1101/744300), the peer-reviewed version of the manuscript was published in [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228333) at [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0228333](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228333).\n\nWe want to see differences in the gills of trained and untrained zebrafishes.\nThe [analysis notebook](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/blob/master/Gills-Analysis.ipynb) was used to read all the raw data and to procuce all figures in the manuscript.\n\nThe tomographic datasets of the delineated fish gills which we used for the analyis can be downloaded on [OSF](https://cos.io/our-products/osf/) here: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A5ESX\nThis should enable you to get exactly the same results as we did, e.g. do some [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).\n\nPlease get in touch with me if you cannot repeat the analysis with this data, I'm happy to help!\nYou can either send me an [email](https://www.anatomie.unibe.ch/haberthu), [file an issue](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/issues) or use the 'chat on Gitter' badge on top to start a chat.\n"},

requested.\n\n### js/simple-graph.js\nWorkhorse of the graphics library.\n\n### index.html\nContains the scaffold of the page.\n\n### delta2js.py\nConverts .delta files to cartesian coordinates.\n\ndelta2js.py MUST be modified to your own project file naming.\n\nIt exports all values to java script files because that's the only type of file that can be loaded in a browser without a web server.\n\nIt exports a list (data/list.js) and several databases (data/*.js);\n\ndata/list.js contains all the available files and their sources (reference, chromosome, target and status), the x/y axis labels and the graphic title.\nThis file will be loaded automatically and will draw the options drop-down list.\n\ndata/*.js contains minimum and maximum values, as well as an array with all coordinates.\n\n#### Run\n``` bash\ncd data\nrm ../../../out/*.js\n../delta2js.py ../../../out/*.delta\ncp -l ../../../out/*.js .\nrm webmummer.tar.xz; tar --exclude .git -ahcvf webmummer.tar.xz

Viewer\n==============================\n\nConversion\n------------\nGiven a set of .delta files, delta2js.py will convert those to javascript (under data/ folder) and create a list.js file.\n\n\nOpening\n-------\nBy opening index.html in a browser (not Internet Explorer), choose reference, chromosome, target species and status.\n\n\nNavigation\n-----------\nThe dot plot will be shown and can be browsed with either the keyboard or mouse.\n\nUse arrow keys, +/-/0, drag with mouse, [shift] double-click, scroll-wheel or use the compass.\n\n\nSaving\n-------\nOn the top left corther of each graph there's a button to save the current view to a svg file.\n\n\nHelp\n-------\nOn the top right corther there's a help message. Hover over it to all configurations and help available.\n\n\nScreenshot\n-------------\n### A diagonal plot for close species\n<img

requested.\n\n### js/simple-graph.js\nWorkhorse of the graphics library.\n\n### index.html\nContains the scaffold of the page.\n\n### delta2js.py\nConverts .delta files to cartesian coordinates.\n\ndelta2js.py MUST be modified to your own project file naming.\n\nIt exports all values to java script files because that's the only type of file that can be loaded in a browser without a web server.\n\nIt exports a list (data/list.js) and several databases (data/*.js);\n\ndata/list.js contains all the available files and their sources (reference, chromosome, target and status), the x/y axis labels and the graphic title.\nThis file will be loaded automatically and will draw the options drop-down list.\n\ndata/*.js contains minimum and maximum values, as well as an array with all coordinates.\n\n#### Run\n``` bash\ncd data\nrm ../../../out/*.js\n../delta2js.py ../../../out/*.delta\ncp -l ../../../out/*.js .\nrm webmummer.tar.xz; tar --exclude .git -ahcvf webmummer.tar.xz

In total the framework with tools consists\nof approximately 20 000 lines of code.\n\n## Functionality:\n* Generating GATE simulation files\n* Perfoming GATE simulations\n* Making range-energy tables, finding the straggling, etc.\n* Tracking analysis: This can be done both simplified and full\n* Simplified: No double-modelling of the pixel diffusion process (use MC provded energy loss), no track reconstruction (use eventID tag to connect tracks from same primary).\n* The 3D reconstruction of phantoms using tracker planes has not yet been implemented\n* Range estimation\n\nThe analysis toolchain has the following components:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Analysis_chain.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe full tracking workflow is implemented in the function <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/getTracks.C::getTracks()</code>, and the tracking and range estimation workflow is found in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::drawBraggPeakGraphFit()</code>.\n\n\n## GATE simulations \n### Geometry scheme\nThe simplified simulation geometry for the future DTC simulations has been proposed as:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Layer_schematics.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nIt is partly based on the ALPIDE design, and the FoCal design. The GATE geometry corresponding to this scheme is based on the following hierarchy:\n```\nWorld -> Scanner1 -> Layer -> Module + Absorber + Air gap\n                              Module = Active sensor + Passive sensor + Glue + PCB + Glue\n      -> Scanner2 -> [Layer] * Number Of Layers\n```\n\nThe idea is that Scanner1 represents the first layer (where e.g. there is no absorber, only air), and that Scanner2 represents all the following (similar) layers which are repeated.\n\n#### Generating the macro files\nTo generate the geometry files to run in Gate, a Python script is supplied.\nIt is located within the ''gate/python'' subfolder.\n```\n[gate/python] $ python gate/python/makeGeometryDTC.py\n```\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/GATE_geometry_builder.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nChoose the wanted characteristics of the detector, and use ''write files'' in order to create the geometry file Module.mac, which is automatically included in Main.mac.\nNote that the option \"Use water degrader phantom\" should be checked (as is the default behavior)!\n\n### Creating the full simulations files for a range-energy look-up-table\nIn this step, 5000-10000 particles are usually sufficient in order to get accurate results.\nTo loop through different energy degrader thicknesses, run the script ''runDegraderFull.sh'':\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegraderFull.sh <absorber thickness> <degraderthickness from> <degraderthickness stepsize> <degraderthickness to>\n```\nThe brackets indicate the folder in the Github repository to run the code from. Please note that the program should not be executed using the <code>sh</code> command, as this refers do different shells in different Linux distribtions, and not all shells support the conditional bash expressions used in the script.\n\n\nFor example, with a 3 mm degrader, and simulating a 250 MeV beam passing through a phantom of 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 mm water:\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegraderFull.sh 3 50 5 70\n```\nPlease note that there is a variable NCORES in this script, which ensures that NCORES versions of the Gate executable are run in parallel, and then waits for the last background process to complete before a new set of NCORES executables are run. So if you set NCORES=8, and run <code>sh runDegraderFull.sh 3 50 1 70</code>, first 50-57 will run in parallel, and when they're done, 58-65 will start, etc. The default value is NCORES=4.\n\n### Creating the chip-readout simulations files for resolution calculation\nIn this step a higher number of particles is desired. I usually use 25000 since we need O(100) simulations. A sub 1-mm step size will really tell us if we manage to detect such small changes in a beam energy.\n\nAnd loop through the different absorber thicknesses:\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegrader.sh <absorber thickness> <degraderthickness from> <degraderthickness stepsize> <degraderthickness to>\n```\nThe same parallel-in-sequential run mode has been configured here.\n\n### Creating the basis for range-energy calculations\n#### The range-energy look-up-table\nNow we have ROOT output files from Gate, all degraded differently through a varying water phantom and therefore stopping at different places in the DTC.\nWe want to follow all the tracks to see where they end, and make a histogram over their stopping positions. This is of course performed from a looped script, but to give a small recipe:\n* Retrieve the first interaction of the first particle. Note its event ID (history number) and edep (energy loss for that particular interaction)\n* Repeat until the particle is outside the phantom. This can be found from the volume ID or the z position (the first interaction with {math|z>0}). Sum all the found edep values, and this is the energy loss inside the phantom. Now we have the \"initial\" energy of the proton before it hits the DTC\n* Follow the particle, noting its z position. When the event ID changes, the next particle is followed, and save the last z position of where the proton stopped in a histogram\n* Do a Gaussian fit of the histogram after all the particles have been followed. The mean value is the range of the beam with that particular \"initial\" energy. The spread is the range straggling. Note that the range straggling is more or less constant, but the contributions to the range straggling from the phantom and DTC, respectively, are varying linearly. \n\nThis recipe has been implemented in <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/findRange.C</code>. Test run the code on a few of the cases (smallest and biggest phantom size ++) to see that\n* The correct start- and end points of the histogram looks sane. If not, this can be corrected for by looking how <code>xfrom</code> and <code>xto</code> is calculated and playing with the calculation.\n* The mean value and straggling is calculated correctly\n* The energy loss is calculated correctly\nYou can run <code>findRange.C</code> in root by compiling and giving it three arguments; Energy of the protons, absorber thickness, and the degrader thickness you wish to inspect. \n\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root \nROOT [1] .L findRange.C+\n// void findRange(Int_t energy, Int_t absorberThickness, Int_t degraderThickness)\nROOT [2] findRange f(250, 3, 50); f.Run();\n```\n\nThe output should look like this: Correctly places Gaussian fits is a good sign.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/FindRanges.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nIf you're happy with this, then a new script will run <code>findRange.C</code> on all the different ROOT files generated earlier.\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root \nROOT [1] .L findManyRangesDegrader.C\n// void findManyRanges(Int_t degraderFrom, Int_t degraderIncrement, Int_t degraderTo, Int_t absorberThicknessMm)\nROOT [2] findManyRanges(50, 5, 70, 3)\n```\n\nThis is a serial process, so don't worry about your CPU.\nThe output is stored in <code>DTCToolkit/Output/findManyRangesDegrader.csv</code>.\nIt is a good idea to look through this file, to check that the values are not very jumpy (Gaussian fits gone wrong).\n\nWe need the initial energy and range in ascending order. The findManyRangesDegrader.csv files contains more rows such as initial energy straggling and range straggling for other calcualations. This is a bit tricky, but do (assuming a 3 mm absorber geometry):\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ cat OutputFiles/findManyRangesDegrader.csv | awk '{print ($6 \" \" $3)}' | sort -n > Data/Ranges/3mm_Al.csv\n```\n\nNB: If there are many different absorber geometries in findManyRangesDegrader, either copy the interesting ones or use <code>| grep \" X \" |</code> to only keep X mm geometry\n\nWhen this is performed, the range-energy table for that particular geometry has been created, and is ready to use in the analysis. Note that since the calculation is based on cubic spline interpolations, it cannot extrapolate -- so have a larger span in the full Monte Carlo simulation data than with the chip readout.

In addition, to calculate the parameters <math>\\alpha, p</math> from the somewhat inaccurate Bragg-Kleeman equation <math>R_0 = \\alpha E ^ p</math>, in order to correctly model the \"depth-dose curve\" <math>dE / dz = p^{-1} \\alpha^{-1/p} (R_0 - z)^{1/p-1}</math>. This happens automatically in <code>DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants/MaterialConstants.C</code>, so there is no need to do this by hand. This step should be followed anyhow, since it is a check of the data produced in the last step: Outliers should be removed or \"fixed\", eg. by manually fitting the conflicting datapoints using <code>findRange.C</code>.\n\nTo find all this, run the script <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/findAPAndStraggling.C</code>. This script will loop through all available data lines in the <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/findManyRangesDegrader.csv</code> file that has the correct absorber thickness, so you need to clean the file first (or just delete it before running <code>findManyRangesDegrader.C</code>).\n\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root\nROOT [0] .L findAPAndStraggling.C+\n// void findAPAndStraggling(int absorberthickness)\nROOT [1] findAPAndStraggling(3)\n```\n\nThe output from this function should be something like this:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/FindAPAndStraggling.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### Configuring the DTC Toolkit to run with correct geometry\nThe values from <code>findManyRanges.C</code> should already be in <code>DTCToolkit/Data/Ranges/3mm_Al.csv</code> (or the corresponding material / thickness).\n\nLook in the file <code>DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants/Constants.h</code> and check that the correct absorber thickness values etc. are set:\n```\n...\n39 Bool_t useDegrader = true;\n...\n52 const Float_t kAbsorberThickness = 3;\n...\n59 Int_t kEventsPerRun = 100000;\n...\n66 const Int_t kMaterial = kAluminum;\n```\n\nSince we don't use tracking but only MC truth in the optimization, the number kEventsPerRun (<math>n_p</math> in the NIMA article) should be higher than the number of primaries per energy.\nIf tracking is to be performed anyhow, turn on the line\n```\nconst kDoTracking = true;\n```\n\n## Running the DTC Toolkit \n\nThe following section will detail how to perform these separate steps. A quick review of the classes available:\n* <code>Hit</code>: A (int x,int y,int layer, float edep) object from a pixel hit. edep information only from MC\n* <code>Hits</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of Hit objects\n* <code>Cluster</code>: A (float x, float y, int layer, float clustersize) object from a cluster of <code>Hit</code>s The (x,y) position is the mean position of all involved hits.\n* <code>Clusters</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects.\n* <code>Track</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects... But only one per layer, and is connected through a physical proton track. Many helpful member functions to calculate track properties.\n* <code>Tracks</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Track</code> objects.\n* <code>Layer</code>: The contents of a single detector layer. Is stored as a <code>TH2F</code> histogram, and has a <code>Layer::findHits</code> function to find hits, as well as the cluster diffusion model <code>Layer::diffuseLayer</code>. It is controlled from a <code>CalorimeterFrame</code> object.\n* <code>CalorimeterFrame</code>: The collection of all <code>Layer</code>s in the detector.\n* <code>DataInterface</code>: The class to talk to DTC data, either through semi-<code>Hit</code> objects as retrieved from Utrecht from the Groningen beam test, or from ROOT files as generated in Gate.\n\n'''Important''': To load all the required files / your own code, include your C++ sources files in the <code>DTCToolkit/Load.C</code> file, after Analysis.C has loaded:\n```\n...\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"Analysis/Analysis.C+\");\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"Analysis/YourFile.C+\"); // Remember to add a + to compile your code\n}\n```\n\n### Data readout: MC, MC + truth, experimental\nIn the class <code>DataInterface</code> there are several functions to read data in ROOT format.\n\n```\nint   getMCFrame(int runNumber, CalorimeterFrame *calorimeterFrameToFill, [..]) <- MC to 2D hit histograms\nvoid  getMCClusters(int runNumber, Clusters *clustersToFill); <-- MC directly to clusters w/edep and eventID\nvoid  getDataFrame(int runNumber, CalorimeterFrame *calorimeterFrameToFill, int energy); <- experimental data to 2D hit histograms\n```\n\nTo e.g. obtain the experimental data, use\n```\nDataInterface *di = new DataInterface();\nCalorimeterFrame *cf = new CalorimeterFrame();\n  \nfor (int i=0; i<numberOfRuns; i++) { // One run is \"readout + track reconstruction\n   di->getDataFrame(i, cf, energy);\n   // From here the object cf will contain one 2D hit histogram for each of the layers\n   // The number of events to readout in one run: kEventsPerRun (in GlobalConstants/Constants.h)\n}\n```\n\nExamples of the usage of these functions are located in <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/getTracks.C</code>.\nPlease note the phenomenological difference between experimental data and MC:\n* Exp. data has some noise, represented as \"hot\" pixels and 1-pixel clusters\n* Exp. data has diffused, spread-out, clusters from physics processes\n* Monte Carlo data has no such noise, and proton hits are represented as 1-pixel clusters (with edep information)\n\n### Pixel diffusion modelling (MC only)\nTo model the pixel diffusion process, i.e. the the diffusion of the electron-hole pair charges generated from the proton track towards nearby pixels, an empirical model has been implemented. It is described in the NIMA article [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]], and also in the source code in  <code>DTCToolkit/Classes/Layer/Layer.C::diffuseLayer</code>.\n\nTo perform this operation on a filled <code>CalorimeterFrame *cf</code>, use\n```\nTRandom3 *gRandom = new TRandom3(0); // use #import <TRandom3.h>\ncf->diffuseFrame(gRandom);\n```\n\n#### Inverse pixel diffusion calculation (MC and exp. data)\nThis process has been inversed in a Python script, and performed with a large number of input cluster sizes. The result is a parameterization between the proton's energy loss in a layer, and the number of activated pixels:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/edep-and-cs.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe function <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/Tools.C::getEdepFromCS(n)</code> contains the parameterization:\n```\nFloat_t getEdepFromCS(Int_t cs) {\n   return -3.92 + 3.9 * cs - 0.0149 * pow(cs,2) + 0.00122 * pow(cs,3) - 1.4998e-5 * pow(cs,4);\n}\n```\n\n### Cluster identification \nCluster identification is the process to find all connected hits (activated pixels) from a single proton in a single layer. It can be done by several algorithms, simple looped neighboring, DBSCAN, ...\nThe process is such:\n* All hits are found from the diffused 2D histograms and stored as <code>Hit</code> objects with <math>(x,y,layer)</math> in a TClonesArray list.\n* This list is indexed by layer number (a new list with the index the first Hit in each layer) to optimize any search\n* The cluster finding algorithm is applied. For every Hit, the Hit list is looped through to find any connected hits. The search is optimized by use of another index list on the vertical position of the Hits. All connected hits (vertical, horizontal and diagonal) are collected in a single Cluster object with <math>(x,y,layer,cluster size)</math>, where the cluster size is the number of its connected pixels.\n\nThis task is simply performed on a diffused <code>CalorimeterFrame *cf</code>:\n```\nHits *hits = cf->findHits();\nClusters *clusters = hits->findClustersFromHits();\n```\n\n### Proton track reconstruction \nThe process of track reconstruction is described fully in [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]].\n\nFrom a collection of cluster objects, <code>Clusters * clusters</code>, use the following code to get a collection of the Track objects connecting them across the layers.\n```\nTracks * tracks = clusters->findCalorimeterTracks();\n```\n\nSome optimization schemes can be applied to the tracks in order to increase their accuracy:\n```\ntracks->extrapolateToLayer0(); // If a track was found starting from the second layer, we want to know the extrapolated vector in the first layer\ntracks->splitSharedClusters(); // If two tracks meet at the same position in a layer, and they share a single cluster, split the cluster into two and give each part to each of the tracks\ntracks->removeTracksLeavingDetector(); // If a track exits laterally from the detector before coming to a stop, remove it\ntracks->removeTracksEndingInBadChannnels(); // ONLY EXP DATA: Use a mask containing all the bad chips to see if a track ends in there. Remove it if it does.\n```\n\n### Putting it all together so far \nIt is not easy to track a large number of proton histories simultaneously, so one may want to loop this analysis, appending the result (the tracks) to a larger Tracks list. This can be done with the code below:\n```\nDataInterface *di = new DataInterface();\nCalorimeterFrame *cf = new CalorimeterFrame();\nTracks * allTracks = new Tracks();\n \nfor (int i=0; i<numberOfRuns; i++) { // One run is \"readout + track reconstruction\n   di->getDataFrame(i, cf, energy);\n   TRandom3 *gRandom = new TRandom3(0); // use #import <TRandom3.h>\n   cf->diffuseFrame(gRandom);\n   Hits *hits = cf->findHits();\n   Clusters *clusters = hits->findClustersFromHits();\n   Tracks * tracks = clusters->findCalorimeterTracks();\n   tracks->extrapolateToLayer0();\n   tracks->splitSharedClusters();\n   tracks->removeTracksLeavingDetector();\n   tracks->removeTracksEndingInBadChannnels();\n    \n   for (int j=0; j<tracks->GetEntriesFast(); j++) {\n      if (!tracks->At(j)) continue;\n      allTracks->appendTrack(tracks->At(j));\n   }\n\n   delete tracks;\n   delete hits;\n   delete clusters;\n}\n```\n\n### Individual tracks: Energy loss fitting \nTo obtain the most likely residual range / stopping range from a Track object, use\n```\ntrack->doRangeFit();\nfloat residualRange = track->getFitParameterRange();\n```\n\nWhat happens here is that a TGraph with the ranges and in-layer energy losses of all the Cluster objects is constructed. A differentiated Bragg Curve is fitted to this TGraph:\n\n<math> f(z) = p^{-1} \\alpha^{-1/p} (R_0 - z)^{1/p-1} </math>\n\nWith <math>p,\\alpha</math> being the parameters found during the full-scoring MC simulations. The value <math>R_0</math>, or <code>track::getFitParameterRange</code> is stored.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/EnergyLossFit.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### (3D reconstruction / MLP estimation) \nWhen the volume reconstruction is implemented, it is to be put here:\n* Calculate the residual range and incoming vectors of all protons\n* Find the Most Likely Path (MLP) of each proton\n* Divide the proton's average energy loss along the MLP\n* Then, with a measure of a number of energy loss values in each voxel, perform some kind of average scheme to find the best value.\n\nInstead, we now treat the complete detector as a single unit / voxel, and find the best SUM of all energy loss values (translated into range). The average scheme used in this case is described below, however this might be different than the best one for the above case.\n\n# Residual range calculation \nTo calculate the most likely residual range from a collection of individual residual ranges is not a simple task!\nIt depends on the average scheme, the distance between the layers, the range straggling etc. Different solutions have been attempted:\n* In cases where the distance between the layers is large compared to the straggling, a histogram bin sum based on the depth of the first layer identified as containing a certain number of proton track endpoints is used. It is the method detailed in the NIMA article [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]], and it is implemented in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::doNGaussianFit(*histogram, *means, *sigmas)</code>.\n* In cases where the distance between the layers is small compared to the straggling, a single Gaussian function is fitted on top of all the proton track endpoints, and the histogram bin sum average value is calculated from minus 4 sigma to plus 4 sigma. This code is located in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::doSimpleGaussianFit(*histogram, *means, *sigmas)</code>. This is the version used for the geometry optimization project.\n\nWith a histogram <code>hRanges</code> containing all the different proton track end points, use\n```\nfloat means[10] = {};\nfloat sigmas[10] = {};\nTF1 *gaussFit = doSimpleGaussianFit(hRanges, means, sigmas);\nprintf(\"The resulting range of the proton beam if %.2f +- %.2f mm.\\n\", means[9], sigmas[9]);\n```\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/ResidualRangeHistogram.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n## Geometry optimization: How does the DTC Toolkit calculate resolution? \nThe resolution in this case is defined as the width of the final range histogram for all protons.\nThe goal is to match the range straggling which manifests itself in the Gaussian distribution of the range of all protons in the DTC, from the full Monte Carlo simulations:\n\nTo characterize the resolution, a realistic analysis is performed. Instead of scoring the complete detector volume, including the massive energy absorbers, only the sensor chips placed at intervals (<math>\\Delta z = 0.375\\ \\textrm{mm} + d_{\\textrm{absorber}}</math>) are scored. Tracks are compiled by using the eventID tag from GATE, so that the track reconstruction efficiency is 100%. Each track is then put in a depth / edep graph, and a Bragg curve is fitted on the data:\n\nThe distribution of all fitted ranges (simple to calculate from fitted energy) should match the distribution above - with a perfect system. All degradations during analysis, sampling error, sparse sampling, mis-fitting etc. will ensure that the peak is broadened.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/HowCalculateResolution.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### Finding the resolution \nTo find this resolution, or degradation in the straggling width, for a single energy, run the DTC toolkit analysis.\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ root Load.C\n// drawBraggPeakGraphFit(Int_t Runs, Int_t dataType = kMC, Bool_t recreate = 0, Float_t energy = 188, Float_t degraderThickness = 0)\nROOT [0] drawBraggPeakGraphFit(1, 0, 1, 250, 34)\n```\nThis is a serial process, so don't worry about your CPU when analysing all ROOT files in one go.\nWith the result\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Distribution_after_analysis2.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe following parameters are then stored in <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/results_makebraggpeakfit.csv</code>:\n\n\n\n| Absorber thickness | Degrader thickness | Nominal WEPL range | Calculated WEPL range | Nominal WEPL straggling | Calculated WEPL straggling |\n| ---------------    | -----------------  | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------    | -------------------------  | \n| 3 (mm)             | 34 (mm)            | 345 (mm WEPL)      | 345.382 (mm WEPL)     | 2.9 (mm WEPL)           | 6.78 (mm WEPL)             |\n\n\nTo perform the analysis on all different degrader thicknesses, use the script <code>DTCToolkit/makeFitResultPlotsDegrader.sh</code> (arguments: degrader from, degrader step and degrader to):\n ```\n [DTCToolkit] $ sh makeFitResultsPlotsDegrader.sh 1 1 380\n ```\nThis may take a few minutes...\nWhen it's finished, it's important to look through the file results_makebraggpeakfit.csv to identify all problem energies, as this is a more complicated analysis than the range finder above.\nIf any is identified, run the drawBraggPeakGraphFit at that specific degrader thickness to see where the problems are.\n\n### Displaying the results\nIf there are no problems, use the script <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/makePlots.C</code> to plot the contents of the file <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/results_makebraggpeakfit.csv</code>:\n   [DTCToolkit/Scripts/optimization] $ root plotRangesAndStraggling.C\nThe output is a map of the accuracy of the range determination, and a comparison between the range resolution (#sigma of the range determination) and its lower limit, the range straggling.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/MakePlots_accuracy.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/MakePlots_resolution.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### A review of the different modules in the code \nTo clone the project, run\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/HelgeEgil/focal\n```\nin a new folder to contain the project. The folder structure will be\n```\n    DTCToolkit/                 <- the reconstruction and analysis code\n    DTCToolkit/Analysis         <- User programs for running the code\n    DTCToolkit/Classes          <- All the classes needed for the project\n    DTCToolkit/Data             <- Data files: Range-energy look up tables, Monte Carlo code, LET data from experiments, the beam data from Groningen, ...\n    DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants  <- Constants to adjust how the programs are run. Material parameters, geometry, ...\n    DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions  <- Small programs to help running the code.\n    DTCToolkit/OutputFiles      <- All output files (csv, jpg, ...) should be put here\n    DTCToolkit/RootFiles        <- ROOT specific configuration files.\n    DTCToolkit/Scripts          <- Independent scripts for helping the analysis. E.g. to create Range-energy look up tables from Monte Carlo data\n    gate/                       <- All Gate-related files\n    gate/python                 <- The DTC geometry builder\n    projects/                   <- Other projects related to WP1\n```\n\nThe best way to learn how to use the code is to look at the user programs, e.g. Analysis.C::DrawBraggPeakGraphFit which is the function used to create the Bragg Peak model fits and beam range estimation used in the 2017 NIMA article. From here it is possible to follow what the code does.\nIt is also a good idea to read through what the different classes are and how they interact:\n* <code>Hit</code>: A (int x,int y,int layer, float edep) object from a pixel hit. edep information only from MC\n* <code>Hits</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of Hit objects\n* <code>Cluster</code>: A (float x, float y, int layer, float clustersize) object from a cluster of <code>Hit</code>s The (x,y) position is the mean position of all involved hits.\n* <code>Clusters</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects.\n* <code>Track</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects... But only one per layer, and is connected through a physical proton track. Many helpful member functions to calculate track properties.\n* <code>Tracks</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Track</code> objects.\n* <code>Layer</code>: The contents of a single detector layer. Is stored as a <code>TH2F</code> histogram, and has a <code>Layer::findHits</code> function to find hits, as well as the cluster diffusion model <code>Layer::diffuseLayer</code>. It is controlled from a <code>CalorimeterFrame</code> object.\n* <code>CalorimeterFrame</code>: The collection of all <code>Layer</code>s in the detector.\n* <code>DataInterface</code>: The class to talk to DTC data, either through semi-<code>Hit</code> objects as retrieved from Utrecht from the Groningen beam test, or from ROOT files as generated in Gate.\n\nTo run the code, do\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ root Load.C\n```\nand ROOT will run the script <code>Load.C</code> which loads all code and starts the interpreter. From here it is possible to directly run scripts as defined in the <code>Analysis.C</code> file:\n```\nROOT [1] drawBraggPeakGraphFit(...)\n```\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 558, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "9b14ca8dc831ce23459e7780f3bed467f305476a 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 101, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-22T14:24:49+02:00"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-22T12:24:57Z", "messageHeadline": "work from bertha", "message": "work from bertha"}}, {"node": {"additions": 17, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-15T15:00:20+02:00"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-15T13:00:26Z", "messageHeadline": "Update from higgsmaster", "message": "Update from higgsmaster"}}, {"node": {"additions": 264, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-15T12:20:20+02:00"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-15T10:20:27Z", "messageHeadline": "Slightly more stable track reconstruction for imaging", "message": "Slightly more stable track reconstruction for imaging"}}, {"node": {"additions": 55, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-15T09:10:38+02:00"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-15T07:10:44Z", "messageHeadline": "Working (compiling?) version of spot sensitive tracking and angular cut", "message": "Working (compiling?) version of spot sensitive tracking and angular cut"}}, {"node": {"additions": 2835, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-15T08:10:58+02:00"}, "pushedDate": "2020-04-15T06:11:07Z", "messageHeadline": "After merge before finishing spotwise correction", "message": "After merge before finishing spotwise correction"}}, {"node": {"additions": 314, "author": {"name": "Helge Pettersen", "email": "helge.pettersen@ift.uib.no", "date": "2020-04-15T08:09:42+02:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Updates from higgsmaster before merge", "message": "Updates from higgsmaster before merge"}}, {"node": {"additions": 301, "author": {"name": "Helge E.

E. S. et al., Proton tracking in a high-granularity Digital Tracking Calorimeter for proton CT purposes. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 860 (C): 51 - 61 (2017)</i>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007 and the PhD thesis <i>A Digital Tracking Calorimeter for Proton Computed Tomography: University of Bergen 2018. http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/17757</i>\n\n## Overview\nIt is developed for the management, pre-processing, reconstruction, analysis and presentation of data from the beam test and from MC simulations.\nIt is of a modular and object-oriented design, such that it should be simple to extend\nthe software with the following purposes in mind: to include analysis data from multiple\nsources such as the next-generation readout electronics and different MC simulation software;\nto give the user a broad selection of different geometrical, physical and reconstruction\nmodels; to include a more extensive proton CT simulation with complex phantoms and positional\ntrackers before and after the phantom or patient; and to facilitate further development\nand usage of the software by making it available as a analysis library.\n\nThe software is written in C++\nand ROOT, with some auxiliary tools written in Python and user scripts written in bash.\nSeveral hands-on teaching workshops have been held at the University of Bergen in order to\ndemonstrate the usage of the software, and summaries of these are available at the project\ndocumentation website https://wiki.uib.no/pct/. In total the framework with tools consists\nof approximately 20 000 lines of code.\n\n## Functionality:\n* Generating GATE simulation files\n* Perfoming GATE simulations\n* Making range-energy tables, finding the straggling, etc.\n* Tracking analysis: This can be done both simplified and full\n* Simplified: No double-modelling of the pixel diffusion process (use MC provded energy loss), no track reconstruction (use eventID tag to connect tracks from same primary).\n* The 3D reconstruction of phantoms using tracker planes has not yet been implemented\n* Range estimation\n\nThe analysis toolchain has the following components:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Analysis_chain.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe full tracking workflow is implemented in the function <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/getTracks.C::getTracks()</code>, and the tracking and range estimation workflow is found in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::drawBraggPeakGraphFit()</code>.\n\n\n## GATE simulations \n### Geometry scheme\nThe simplified simulation geometry for the future DTC simulations has been proposed as:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Layer_schematics.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nIt is partly based on the ALPIDE design, and the FoCal design. The GATE geometry corresponding to this scheme is based on the following hierarchy:\n```\nWorld -> Scanner1 -> Layer -> Module + Absorber + Air gap\n                              Module = Active sensor + Passive sensor + Glue + PCB + Glue\n      -> Scanner2 -> [Layer] * Number Of Layers\n```\n\nThe idea is that Scanner1 represents the first layer (where e.g. there is no absorber, only air), and that Scanner2 represents all the following (similar) layers which are repeated.\n\n#### Generating the macro files\nTo generate the geometry files to run in Gate, a Python script is supplied.\nIt is located within the ''gate/python'' subfolder.\n```\n[gate/python] $ python gate/python/makeGeometryDTC.py\n```\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/GATE_geometry_builder.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nChoose the wanted characteristics of the detector, and use ''write files'' in order to create the geometry file Module.mac, which is automatically included in Main.mac.\nNote that the option \"Use water degrader phantom\" should be checked (as is the default behavior)!\n\n### Creating the full simulations files for a range-energy look-up-table\nIn this step, 5000-10000 particles are usually sufficient in order to get accurate results.\nTo loop through different energy degrader thicknesses, run the script ''runDegraderFull.sh'':\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegraderFull.sh <absorber thickness> <degraderthickness from> <degraderthickness stepsize> <degraderthickness to>\n```\nThe brackets indicate the folder in the Github repository to run the code from. Please note that the program should not be executed using the <code>sh</code> command, as this refers do different shells in different Linux distribtions, and not all shells support the conditional bash expressions used in the script.\n\n\nFor example, with a 3 mm degrader, and simulating a 250 MeV beam passing through a phantom of 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 mm water:\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegraderFull.sh 3 50 5 70\n```\nPlease note that there is a variable NCORES in this script, which ensures that NCORES versions of the Gate executable are run in parallel, and then waits for the last background process to complete before a new set of NCORES executables are run. So if you set NCORES=8, and run <code>sh runDegraderFull.sh 3 50 1 70</code>, first 50-57 will run in parallel, and when they're done, 58-65 will start, etc. The default value is NCORES=4.\n\n### Creating the chip-readout simulations files for resolution calculation\nIn this step a higher number of particles is desired. I usually use 25000 since we need O(100) simulations. A sub 1-mm step size will really tell us if we manage to detect such small changes in a beam energy.\n\nAnd loop through the different absorber thicknesses:\n```\n[gate/python] $ ./runDegrader.sh <absorber thickness> <degraderthickness from> <degraderthickness stepsize> <degraderthickness to>\n```\nThe same parallel-in-sequential run mode has been configured here.\n\n### Creating the basis for range-energy calculations\n#### The range-energy look-up-table\nNow we have ROOT output files from Gate, all degraded differently through a varying water phantom and therefore stopping at different places in the DTC.\nWe want to follow all the tracks to see where they end, and make a histogram over their stopping positions. This is of course performed from a looped script, but to give a small recipe:\n* Retrieve the first interaction of the first particle. Note its event ID (history number) and edep (energy loss for that particular interaction)\n* Repeat until the particle is outside the phantom. This can be found from the volume ID or the z position (the first interaction with {math|z>0}). Sum all the found edep values, and this is the energy loss inside the phantom. Now we have the \"initial\" energy of the proton before it hits the DTC\n* Follow the particle, noting its z position. When the event ID changes, the next particle is followed, and save the last z position of where the proton stopped in a histogram\n* Do a Gaussian fit of the histogram after all the particles have been followed. The mean value is the range of the beam with that particular \"initial\" energy. The spread is the range straggling. Note that the range straggling is more or less constant, but the contributions to the range straggling from the phantom and DTC, respectively, are varying linearly. \n\nThis recipe has been implemented in <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/findRange.C</code>. Test run the code on a few of the cases (smallest and biggest phantom size ++) to see that\n* The correct start- and end points of the histogram looks sane. If not, this can be corrected for by looking how <code>xfrom</code> and <code>xto</code> is calculated and playing with the calculation.\n* The mean value and straggling is calculated correctly\n* The energy loss is calculated correctly\nYou can run <code>findRange.C</code> in root by compiling and giving it three arguments; Energy of the protons, absorber thickness, and the degrader thickness you wish to inspect. \n\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root \nROOT [1] .L findRange.C+\n// void findRange(Int_t energy, Int_t absorberThickness, Int_t degraderThickness)\nROOT [2] findRange f(250, 3, 50); f.Run();\n```\n\nThe output should look like this: Correctly places Gaussian fits is a good sign.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/FindRanges.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nIf you're happy with this, then a new script will run <code>findRange.C</code> on all the different ROOT files generated earlier.\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root \nROOT [1] .L findManyRangesDegrader.C\n// void findManyRanges(Int_t degraderFrom, Int_t degraderIncrement, Int_t degraderTo, Int_t absorberThicknessMm)\nROOT [2] findManyRanges(50, 5, 70, 3)\n```\n\nThis is a serial process, so don't worry about your CPU.\nThe output is stored in <code>DTCToolkit/Output/findManyRangesDegrader.csv</code>.\nIt is a good idea to look through this file, to check that the values are not very jumpy (Gaussian fits gone wrong).\n\nWe need the initial energy and range in ascending order. The findManyRangesDegrader.csv files contains more rows such as initial energy straggling and range straggling for other calcualations. This is a bit tricky, but do (assuming a 3 mm absorber geometry):\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ cat OutputFiles/findManyRangesDegrader.csv | awk '{print ($6 \" \" $3)}' | sort -n > Data/Ranges/3mm_Al.csv\n```\n\nNB: If there are many different absorber geometries in findManyRangesDegrader, either copy the interesting ones or use <code>| grep \" X \" |</code> to only keep X mm geometry\n\nWhen this is performed, the range-energy table for that particular geometry has been created, and is ready to use in the analysis. Note that since the calculation is based on cubic spline interpolations, it cannot extrapolate -- so have a larger span in the full Monte Carlo simulation data than with the chip readout. For more information about that process, see this document: \n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/HowCalculateResolution.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### Range straggling parameterization and <math>R_0 = \\alpha E^p</math>\nIt is important to know the amount of range straggling in the detector, and the amount of energy straggling after the degrader. In addition, to calculate the parameters <math>\\alpha, p</math> from the somewhat inaccurate Bragg-Kleeman equation <math>R_0 = \\alpha E ^ p</math>, in order to correctly model the \"depth-dose curve\" <math>dE / dz = p^{-1} \\alpha^{-1/p} (R_0 - z)^{1/p-1}</math>. This happens automatically in <code>DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants/MaterialConstants.C</code>, so there is no need to do this by hand. This step should be followed anyhow, since it is a check of the data produced in the last step: Outliers should be removed or \"fixed\", eg. by manually fitting the conflicting datapoints using <code>findRange.C</code>.\n\nTo find all this, run the script <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/findAPAndStraggling.C</code>. This script will loop through all available data lines in the <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/findManyRangesDegrader.csv</code> file that has the correct absorber thickness, so you need to clean the file first (or just delete it before running <code>findManyRangesDegrader.C</code>).\n\n```\n[DTCToolkit/Scripts] $ root\nROOT [0] .L findAPAndStraggling.C+\n// void findAPAndStraggling(int absorberthickness)\nROOT [1] findAPAndStraggling(3)\n```\n\nThe output from this function should be something like this:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/FindAPAndStraggling.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### Configuring the DTC Toolkit to run with correct geometry\nThe values from <code>findManyRanges.C</code> should already be in <code>DTCToolkit/Data/Ranges/3mm_Al.csv</code> (or the corresponding material / thickness).\n\nLook in the file <code>DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants/Constants.h</code> and check that the correct absorber thickness values etc. are set:\n```\n...\n39 Bool_t useDegrader = true;\n...\n52 const Float_t kAbsorberThickness = 3;\n...\n59 Int_t kEventsPerRun = 100000;\n...\n66 const Int_t kMaterial = kAluminum;\n```\n\nSince we don't use tracking but only MC truth in the optimization, the number kEventsPerRun (<math>n_p</math> in the NIMA article) should be higher than the number of primaries per energy.\nIf tracking is to be performed anyhow, turn on the line\n```\nconst kDoTracking = true;\n```\n\n## Running the DTC Toolkit \n\nThe following section will detail how to perform these separate steps. A quick review of the classes available:\n* <code>Hit</code>: A (int x,int y,int layer, float edep) object from a pixel hit. edep information only from MC\n* <code>Hits</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of Hit objects\n* <code>Cluster</code>: A (float x, float y, int layer, float clustersize) object from a cluster of <code>Hit</code>s The (x,y) position is the mean position of all involved hits.\n* <code>Clusters</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects.\n* <code>Track</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects... But only one per layer, and is connected through a physical proton track. Many helpful member functions to calculate track properties.\n* <code>Tracks</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Track</code> objects.\n* <code>Layer</code>: The contents of a single detector layer. Is stored as a <code>TH2F</code> histogram, and has a <code>Layer::findHits</code> function to find hits, as well as the cluster diffusion model <code>Layer::diffuseLayer</code>. It is controlled from a <code>CalorimeterFrame</code> object.\n* <code>CalorimeterFrame</code>: The collection of all <code>Layer</code>s in the detector.\n* <code>DataInterface</code>: The class to talk to DTC data, either through semi-<code>Hit</code> objects as retrieved from Utrecht from the Groningen beam test, or from ROOT files as generated in Gate.\n\n'''Important''': To load all the required files / your own code, include your C++ sources files in the <code>DTCToolkit/Load.C</code> file, after Analysis.C has loaded:\n```\n...\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"Analysis/Analysis.C+\");\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"Analysis/YourFile.C+\"); // Remember to add a + to compile your code\n}\n```\n\n### Data readout: MC, MC + truth, experimental\nIn the class <code>DataInterface</code> there are several functions to read data in ROOT format.\n\n```\nint   getMCFrame(int runNumber, CalorimeterFrame *calorimeterFrameToFill, [..]) <- MC to 2D hit histograms\nvoid  getMCClusters(int runNumber, Clusters *clustersToFill); <-- MC directly to clusters w/edep and eventID\nvoid  getDataFrame(int runNumber, CalorimeterFrame *calorimeterFrameToFill, int energy); <- experimental data to 2D hit histograms\n```\n\nTo e.g. obtain the experimental data, use\n```\nDataInterface *di = new DataInterface();\nCalorimeterFrame *cf = new CalorimeterFrame();\n  \nfor (int i=0; i<numberOfRuns; i++) { // One run is \"readout + track reconstruction\n   di->getDataFrame(i, cf, energy);\n   // From here the object cf will contain one 2D hit histogram for each of the layers\n   // The number of events to readout in one run: kEventsPerRun (in GlobalConstants/Constants.h)\n}\n```\n\nExamples of the usage of these functions are located in <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/getTracks.C</code>.\nPlease note the phenomenological difference between experimental data and MC:\n* Exp. data has some noise, represented as \"hot\" pixels and 1-pixel clusters\n* Exp. data has diffused, spread-out, clusters from physics processes\n* Monte Carlo data has no such noise, and proton hits are represented as 1-pixel clusters (with edep information)\n\n### Pixel diffusion modelling (MC only)\nTo model the pixel diffusion process, i.e. the the diffusion of the electron-hole pair charges generated from the proton track towards nearby pixels, an empirical model has been implemented. It is described in the NIMA article [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]], and also in the source code in  <code>DTCToolkit/Classes/Layer/Layer.C::diffuseLayer</code>.\n\nTo perform this operation on a filled <code>CalorimeterFrame *cf</code>, use\n```\nTRandom3 *gRandom = new TRandom3(0); // use #import <TRandom3.h>\ncf->diffuseFrame(gRandom);\n```\n\n#### Inverse pixel diffusion calculation (MC and exp. data)\nThis process has been inversed in a Python script, and performed with a large number of input cluster sizes. The result is a parameterization between the proton's energy loss in a layer, and the number of activated pixels:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/edep-and-cs.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe function <code>DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions/Tools.C::getEdepFromCS(n)</code> contains the parameterization:\n```\nFloat_t getEdepFromCS(Int_t cs) {\n   return -3.92 + 3.9 * cs - 0.0149 * pow(cs,2) + 0.00122 * pow(cs,3) - 1.4998e-5 * pow(cs,4);\n}\n```\n\n### Cluster identification \nCluster identification is the process to find all connected hits (activated pixels) from a single proton in a single layer. It can be done by several algorithms, simple looped neighboring, DBSCAN, ...\nThe process is such:\n* All hits are found from the diffused 2D histograms and stored as <code>Hit</code> objects with <math>(x,y,layer)</math> in a TClonesArray list.\n* This list is indexed by layer number (a new list with the index the first Hit in each layer) to optimize any search\n* The cluster finding algorithm is applied. For every Hit, the Hit list is looped through to find any connected hits. The search is optimized by use of another index list on the vertical position of the Hits. All connected hits (vertical, horizontal and diagonal) are collected in a single Cluster object with <math>(x,y,layer,cluster size)</math>, where the cluster size is the number of its connected pixels.\n\nThis task is simply performed on a diffused <code>CalorimeterFrame *cf</code>:\n```\nHits *hits = cf->findHits();\nClusters *clusters = hits->findClustersFromHits();\n```\n\n### Proton track reconstruction \nThe process of track reconstruction is described fully in [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]].\n\nFrom a collection of cluster objects, <code>Clusters * clusters</code>, use the following code to get a collection of the Track objects connecting them across the layers.\n```\nTracks * tracks = clusters->findCalorimeterTracks();\n```\n\nSome optimization schemes can be applied to the tracks in order to increase their accuracy:\n```\ntracks->extrapolateToLayer0(); // If a track was found starting from the second layer, we want to know the extrapolated vector in the first layer\ntracks->splitSharedClusters(); // If two tracks meet at the same position in a layer, and they share a single cluster, split the cluster into two and give each part to each of the tracks\ntracks->removeTracksLeavingDetector(); // If a track exits laterally from the detector before coming to a stop, remove it\ntracks->removeTracksEndingInBadChannnels(); // ONLY EXP DATA: Use a mask containing all the bad chips to see if a track ends in there. Remove it if it does.\n```\n\n### Putting it all together so far \nIt is not easy to track a large number of proton histories simultaneously, so one may want to loop this analysis, appending the result (the tracks) to a larger Tracks list. This can be done with the code below:\n```\nDataInterface *di = new DataInterface();\nCalorimeterFrame *cf = new CalorimeterFrame();\nTracks * allTracks = new Tracks();\n \nfor (int i=0; i<numberOfRuns; i++) { // One run is \"readout + track reconstruction\n   di->getDataFrame(i, cf, energy);\n   TRandom3 *gRandom = new TRandom3(0); // use #import <TRandom3.h>\n   cf->diffuseFrame(gRandom);\n   Hits *hits = cf->findHits();\n   Clusters *clusters = hits->findClustersFromHits();\n   Tracks * tracks = clusters->findCalorimeterTracks();\n   tracks->extrapolateToLayer0();\n   tracks->splitSharedClusters();\n   tracks->removeTracksLeavingDetector();\n   tracks->removeTracksEndingInBadChannnels();\n    \n   for (int j=0; j<tracks->GetEntriesFast(); j++) {\n      if (!tracks->At(j)) continue;\n      allTracks->appendTrack(tracks->At(j));\n   }\n\n   delete tracks;\n   delete hits;\n   delete clusters;\n}\n```\n\n### Individual tracks: Energy loss fitting \nTo obtain the most likely residual range / stopping range from a Track object, use\n```\ntrack->doRangeFit();\nfloat residualRange = track->getFitParameterRange();\n```\n\nWhat happens here is that a TGraph with the ranges and in-layer energy losses of all the Cluster objects is constructed. A differentiated Bragg Curve is fitted to this TGraph:\n\n<math> f(z) = p^{-1} \\alpha^{-1/p} (R_0 - z)^{1/p-1} </math>\n\nWith <math>p,\\alpha</math> being the parameters found during the full-scoring MC simulations. The value <math>R_0</math>, or <code>track::getFitParameterRange</code> is stored.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/EnergyLossFit.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### (3D reconstruction / MLP estimation) \nWhen the volume reconstruction is implemented, it is to be put here:\n* Calculate the residual range and incoming vectors of all protons\n* Find the Most Likely Path (MLP) of each proton\n* Divide the proton's average energy loss along the MLP\n* Then, with a measure of a number of energy loss values in each voxel, perform some kind of average scheme to find the best value.\n\nInstead, we now treat the complete detector as a single unit / voxel, and find the best SUM of all energy loss values (translated into range). The average scheme used in this case is described below, however this might be different than the best one for the above case.\n\n# Residual range calculation \nTo calculate the most likely residual range from a collection of individual residual ranges is not a simple task!\nIt depends on the average scheme, the distance between the layers, the range straggling etc. Different solutions have been attempted:\n* In cases where the distance between the layers is large compared to the straggling, a histogram bin sum based on the depth of the first layer identified as containing a certain number of proton track endpoints is used. It is the method detailed in the NIMA article [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.02.007]], and it is implemented in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::doNGaussianFit(*histogram, *means, *sigmas)</code>.\n* In cases where the distance between the layers is small compared to the straggling, a single Gaussian function is fitted on top of all the proton track endpoints, and the histogram bin sum average value is calculated from minus 4 sigma to plus 4 sigma. This code is located in <code>DTCToolkit/Analysis/Analysis.C::doSimpleGaussianFit(*histogram, *means, *sigmas)</code>. This is the version used for the geometry optimization project.\n\nWith a histogram <code>hRanges</code> containing all the different proton track end points, use\n```\nfloat means[10] = {};\nfloat sigmas[10] = {};\nTF1 *gaussFit = doSimpleGaussianFit(hRanges, means, sigmas);\nprintf(\"The resulting range of the proton beam if %.2f +- %.2f mm.\\n\", means[9], sigmas[9]);\n```\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/ResidualRangeHistogram.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n## Geometry optimization: How does the DTC Toolkit calculate resolution? \nThe resolution in this case is defined as the width of the final range histogram for all protons.\nThe goal is to match the range straggling which manifests itself in the Gaussian distribution of the range of all protons in the DTC, from the full Monte Carlo simulations:\n\nTo characterize the resolution, a realistic analysis is performed. Instead of scoring the complete detector volume, including the massive energy absorbers, only the sensor chips placed at intervals (<math>\\Delta z = 0.375\\ \\textrm{mm} + d_{\\textrm{absorber}}</math>) are scored. Tracks are compiled by using the eventID tag from GATE, so that the track reconstruction efficiency is 100%. Each track is then put in a depth / edep graph, and a Bragg curve is fitted on the data:\n\nThe distribution of all fitted ranges (simple to calculate from fitted energy) should match the distribution above - with a perfect system. All degradations during analysis, sampling error, sparse sampling, mis-fitting etc. will ensure that the peak is broadened.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/HowCalculateResolution.PNG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### Finding the resolution \nTo find this resolution, or degradation in the straggling width, for a single energy, run the DTC toolkit analysis.\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ root Load.C\n// drawBraggPeakGraphFit(Int_t Runs, Int_t dataType = kMC, Bool_t recreate = 0, Float_t energy = 188, Float_t degraderThickness = 0)\nROOT [0] drawBraggPeakGraphFit(1, 0, 1, 250, 34)\n```\nThis is a serial process, so don't worry about your CPU when analysing all ROOT files in one go.\nWith the result\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/Distribution_after_analysis2.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe following parameters are then stored in <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/results_makebraggpeakfit.csv</code>:\n\n\n\n| Absorber thickness | Degrader thickness | Nominal WEPL range | Calculated WEPL range | Nominal WEPL straggling | Calculated WEPL straggling |\n| ---------------    | -----------------  | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------    | -------------------------  | \n| 3 (mm)             | 34 (mm)            | 345 (mm WEPL)      | 345.382 (mm WEPL)     | 2.9 (mm WEPL)           | 6.78 (mm WEPL)             |\n\n\nTo perform the analysis on all different degrader thicknesses, use the script <code>DTCToolkit/makeFitResultPlotsDegrader.sh</code> (arguments: degrader from, degrader step and degrader to):\n ```\n [DTCToolkit] $ sh makeFitResultsPlotsDegrader.sh 1 1 380\n ```\nThis may take a few minutes...\nWhen it's finished, it's important to look through the file results_makebraggpeakfit.csv to identify all problem energies, as this is a more complicated analysis than the range finder above.\nIf any is identified, run the drawBraggPeakGraphFit at that specific degrader thickness to see where the problems are.\n\n### Displaying the results\nIf there are no problems, use the script <code>DTCToolkit/Scripts/makePlots.C</code> to plot the contents of the file <code>DTCToolkit/OutputFiles/results_makebraggpeakfit.csv</code>:\n   [DTCToolkit/Scripts/optimization] $ root plotRangesAndStraggling.C\nThe output is a map of the accuracy of the range determination, and a comparison between the range resolution (#sigma of the range determination) and its lower limit, the range straggling.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/MakePlots_accuracy.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelgeEgil/focal/master/projects/Readme/MakePlots_resolution.JPG \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n### A review of the different modules in the code \nTo clone the project, run\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/HelgeEgil/focal\n```\nin a new folder to contain the project. The folder structure will be\n```\n    DTCToolkit/                 <- the reconstruction and analysis code\n    DTCToolkit/Analysis         <- User programs for running the code\n    DTCToolkit/Classes          <- All the classes needed for the project\n    DTCToolkit/Data             <- Data files: Range-energy look up tables, Monte Carlo code, LET data from experiments, the beam data from Groningen, ...\n    DTCToolkit/GlobalConstants  <- Constants to adjust how the programs are run. Material parameters, geometry, ...\n    DTCToolkit/HelperFunctions  <- Small programs to help running the code.\n    DTCToolkit/OutputFiles      <- All output files (csv, jpg, ...) should be put here\n    DTCToolkit/RootFiles        <- ROOT specific configuration files.\n    DTCToolkit/Scripts          <- Independent scripts for helping the analysis. E.g. to create Range-energy look up tables from Monte Carlo data\n    gate/                       <- All Gate-related files\n    gate/python                 <- The DTC geometry builder\n    projects/                   <- Other projects related to WP1\n```\n\nThe best way to learn how to use the code is to look at the user programs, e.g. Analysis.C::DrawBraggPeakGraphFit which is the function used to create the Bragg Peak model fits and beam range estimation used in the 2017 NIMA article. From here it is possible to follow what the code does.\nIt is also a good idea to read through what the different classes are and how they interact:\n* <code>Hit</code>: A (int x,int y,int layer, float edep) object from a pixel hit. edep information only from MC\n* <code>Hits</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of Hit objects\n* <code>Cluster</code>: A (float x, float y, int layer, float clustersize) object from a cluster of <code>Hit</code>s The (x,y) position is the mean position of all involved hits.\n* <code>Clusters</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects.\n* <code>Track</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Cluster</code> objects... But only one per layer, and is connected through a physical proton track. Many helpful member functions to calculate track properties.\n* <code>Tracks</code>: A <code>TClonesArray</code> collection of <code>Track</code> objects.\n* <code>Layer</code>: The contents of a single detector layer. Is stored as a <code>TH2F</code> histogram, and has a <code>Layer::findHits</code> function to find hits, as well as the cluster diffusion model <code>Layer::diffuseLayer</code>. It is controlled from a <code>CalorimeterFrame</code> object.\n* <code>CalorimeterFrame</code>: The collection of all <code>Layer</code>s in the detector.\n* <code>DataInterface</code>: The class to talk to DTC data, either through semi-<code>Hit</code> objects as retrieved from Utrecht from the Groningen beam test, or from ROOT files as generated in Gate.\n\nTo run the code, do\n```\n[DTCToolkit] $ root Load.C\n```\nand ROOT will run the script <code>Load.C</code> which loads all code and starts the interpreter. From here it is possible to directly run scripts as defined in the <code>Analysis.C</code> file:\n```\nROOT [1] drawBraggPeakGraphFit(...)\n```\n"}, "daskelly/ase": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "daskelly/ase", "diskUsage": 176, "name": "ase", "owner": {"login": "daskelly"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "R"}, {"name": "Makefile"}, {"name": "TeX"}]}, "createdAt": "2016-06-14T16:23:56Z", "pushedAt": "2016-06-16T15:14:59Z", "object": {"text": "# Allele-specific expression\n\nThis repository contains code to implement the model of allele-specific \nexpression (ASE) described in Skelly et al. 2011 Genome Research \n[doi:10.1101/gr.119784.110](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.119784.110).\n\nThe directory [biased_SNPs](biased_SNPs) provides code to implement the model\nfor detecting biased SNPs from DNA data. These SNPs are then filtered out for all\nsubsequent analyses. This model is described in section S1.3.1 of the \nsupplementary material. See the README in that directory for more details.\n\nThe directory [DNA_model](DNA_model) provides code to implement the model\nfor genomic DNA read counts that estimates overdispersion in this \"null\" data where \nno genes should show ASE. This model is described in section 1.3.2 of the \nsupplementary material. See the README in that directory for more details.\n\nThe directory [RNA_model](RNA_model) provides code to implement the model\nto detect ASE in read counts derived from RNA. This model is described in section 1.3.3 \nof the supplementary material. See the README in that directory for more details.\n\n[This tutorial](tutorial.pdf) (PDF) provides an overview of how to use\nscripts in the `DNA_model/orig` and `RNA_model/orig` directories to implement\nour statistical model for ASE. These are the scripts that were originally\nreleased with the paper and are available on the *Genome Research*\nwebsite as supplementary information. They have a few corrections from\nthe exact code published on the *Genome Research* website to account for\nbugs discovered after publication as well as changes to dependencies \nthat the code

We then define a numerical method by approximately propagating each of those simpler systems for small increments of time in a specified order.\n\n(TODO: Add LaTeX-rendered Langevin system with underbraces around `O`, `R`, `V` components, using `readme2tex`)\n\nWe will refer to a numerical scheme by its encoding string. For example, `OVRVO` means: simulate the `O` component for a time increment of $\\Delta t/2$, then the `V` component for $\\Delta t/2$, then the `R` component for $\\Delta t$, then the `V` component for $\\Delta t/2$, and finally the `O` component for $\\Delta t/2$. This approximately propagates the entire system for a total time increment of $\\Delta t$.\n\n## This introduces error that can be sensitive to details\nUsing subtly different numerical schemes for the same continuous equations can lead to drastically different behavior at finite timesteps.\nAs a prototypical example, consider the difference between the behavior of schemes `VRORV` and `OVRVO` on a 1D quartic system:\n\n![quartic_eq_joint_dist_array_w_x_marginals](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5759036/25289560/147862fa-2698-11e7-8f95-9b463953f2de.jpg)\n\n($\\rho$ is the density sampled by the numerical scheme, and $\\pi$ is the exact target density.\nEach column illustrates an increasing finite timestep $\\Delta t$, below the \"stability threshold.\"\nRows 2 and 4 illustrate error in the sampled joint distribution, and rows 1 and 3 illustrate error in the sampled $\\mathbf{x}$-marginal distribution.)\n\nThe two schemes have the same computational cost per iteration, and introduce nearly identical levels of error into the sampled joint $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v})$ distribution -- but one of these methods introduces about 100x more error in the $\\mathbf{x}$ marginal than the other at large timesteps!\n\n### Toy implementation\nTo illustrate the scheme, here is a toy Python implementation for each of the explicit updates:\n```python\n# Defined elsewhere: friction coefficient `gamma`, mass `m`\n\ndef propagate_R(x, v, h): \n    \"\"\"Linear \"drift\" -- deterministic position update\n    using current velocities\"\"\"\n    return (x + (h * v), v)\n\ndef propagate_V(x, v, h):\n    \"\"\"Linear \"kick\" -- deterministic velocity update\n    using current forces\"\"\"\n    return (x, v + (h * force(x) / m))\n\ndef propagate_O(x, v, h):\n    \"\"\"Ornstein-Uhlenbeck -- stochastic velocity update\n    using a ficticious \"heat-bath\"\"\"\"\n    a, b = exp(-gamma * h), sqrt(1 - exp(-2 * gamma * h))\n    return (x, (a * v) + b * draw_maxwell_boltzmann_velocities())\n\npropagate = {\"O\": propagate_O, \"R\": propagate_R, \"V\": propagate_V}\n```\nwhere `draw_maxwell_boltzmann_velocities()` draws an independent sample from the velocity distribution given by the masses and temperature.\n\nUsing the functions we just defined, here's how to implement the inner-loop of the scheme denoted `OVRVO`:\n```python\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt / 2)\n```\n\nAnd here's the `VRORV` inner-loop:\n```python\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\n```\n\nAs suggested from these examples, the generic recipe for turning a splitting string into a Langevin integrator is:\n\n```python\ndef get_n(substep=\"O\", splitting=\"OVRVO\"):\n    return sum([s == substep for s in splitting])\n\ndef simulate_timestep(x, v, dt, splitting=\"OVRVO\"):\n    for substep in splitting:\n        x, v = propagate[substep](x, v, dt / get_n(substep, splitting))\n    return x, v\n```\n\n# Systematically enumerating numerical schemes and measuring their error\nIn this repository, we enumerate numerical schemes for Langevin dynamics by associating strings over the alphabet `{O, R, V}` with explicit numerical methods using [OpenMM `CustomIntegrator`](http://docs.openmm.org/7.1.0/userguide/theory.html#customintegrator)s. We provide schemes for approximating the error introduced by that method in the sampled distribution over $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}) jointly or $\\mathbf{x}$ alone using nonequilibrium work theorems.\nWe further investigate the effects of modifying the mass matrix (aka \"hydrogen mass repartitioning\") and/or evaluating subsets of the forces per substep (aka \"multi-timestep\" methods, obtained by expanding the alphabet to `{O, R, V0, V1, ..., V32}`).\n\n(TODO: Details on nonequilibrium error measurement scheme.)\n\n## Relation to prior work\nWe did not introduce the concept of splitting the Langevin system into these three \"building blocks\" -- this decomposition is developed lucidly in Chapter 7 of [[Leimkuhler and Matthews, 2015]](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319163741). We also did not discover the `VRORV` integrator -- Leimkuhler and Matthews have studied the favorable properties of particular integrator `VRORV` (\"`BAOAB`\" in their notation) in great detail.\nHere, we have:\n1. provided a method to translate these strings into efficient `CustomIntegrators` in OpenMM,\n2. provided a uniform scheme for measuring the sampling error introduced by any member of this family of methods on any target density (approximating the KL divergence directly, rather than monitoring error in a system-specific choice of low-dimensional observable),\n3. considered an expanded alphabet, encompassing many widely-used variants as special cases.\n\n# References\n(TODO: Add references from paper!)"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 464, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "bb307e6ebf476b652e62e41ae49730f530732da3 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 6361, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "josh.fass@choderalab.org", "date": "2018-02-12T14:49:29-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-12T19:49:31Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge pull request #48 from choderalab/estimator-analysis-and-plotting", "message": "Merge pull request #48 from choderalab/estimator-analysis-and-plotting\n\nEntropy submission"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1245, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T13:11:40-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-12T18:12:29Z", "messageHeadline": "Include notebook for Figure 5", "message": "Include notebook for Figure 5\n\n(Also includes a few cells checking that phase-space D_KL scales\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of O(\\Delta t^4) to O(\\Delta t^5))"}}, {"node": {"additions": 3004, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T13:00:40-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-12T18:01:30Z", "messageHeadline": "Include notebook for Figures 2,3,A1", "message": "Include notebook for Figures 2,3,A1"}}, {"node": {"additions": 342, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T12:05:27-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-12T17:07:51Z", "messageHeadline": "Include notebook to generate Figure A2", "message": "Include notebook to generate Figure A2"}}, {"node": {"additions": 198, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T11:28:17-05:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Include old water-cluster plots", "message": "Include old water-cluster plots"}}, {"node": {"additions": 172, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T11:10:04-05:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Include notebook for producing Figure 4", "message": "Include notebook for producing Figure 4"}}, {"node": {"additions": 855, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-12T11:09:31-05:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Include notebook for producing Figure 6", "message": "Include notebook for producing Figure 6"}}, {"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-11T11:34:23-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-11T16:35:16Z", "messageHeadline": "fix typo", "message": "fix typo"}}, {"node": {"additions": 18, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-11T11:26:20-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-11T16:30:54Z", "messageHeadline": "Update result-collector script for parallel outputs", "message": "Update result-collector script for parallel outputs"}}, {"node": {"additions": 8, "author": {"name": "Josh Fass", "email": "jf694@cornell.edu", "date": "2018-02-10T19:23:29-05:00"}, "pushedDate": "2018-02-11T00:25:33Z", "messageHeadline": "5x more samples, shorter second-leg", "message": "5x more samples, shorter second-leg\n\nProducing a second version of Figure 6 to report in Appendix or as a\nsecond panel of Figure 6.

Status](https://travis-ci.org/choderalab/integrator-benchmark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/choderalab/integrator-benchmark?branch=master)\n\n\n# Not all Langevin integrators are equal\n\nEnumerating and evaluating numerical schemes for Langevin dynamics\n\n## Molecular dynamics requires methods for simulating continuous equations in discrete steps\nA widely-used approach to investigating equilibrium properties is to simulate Langevin dynamics.\nLangevin dynamics is a system of stochastic differential equations defined on a state space of configurations $\\mathbf{x}$ and velocities $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\nTo simulate those equations on a computer, we need to provide explicit instructions for advancing the state of the system $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v})$ by very small time increments.\n\nHere, we will consider the family of methods that can be derived by splitting the Langevin system into a sum of three simpler systems, labeled `O`, `R`, and `V`. We then define a numerical method by approximately propagating each of those simpler systems for small increments of time in a specified order.\n\n(TODO: Add LaTeX-rendered Langevin system with underbraces around `O`, `R`, `V` components, using `readme2tex`)\n\nWe will refer to a numerical scheme by its encoding string. For example, `OVRVO` means: simulate the `O` component for a time increment of $\\Delta t/2$, then the `V` component for $\\Delta t/2$, then the `R` component for $\\Delta t$, then the `V` component for $\\Delta t/2$, and finally the `O` component for $\\Delta t/2$. This approximately propagates the entire system for a total time increment of $\\Delta t$.\n\n## This introduces error that can be sensitive to details\nUsing subtly different numerical schemes for the same continuous equations can lead to drastically different behavior at finite timesteps.\nAs a prototypical example, consider the difference between the behavior of schemes `VRORV` and `OVRVO` on a 1D quartic system:\n\n![quartic_eq_joint_dist_array_w_x_marginals](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5759036/25289560/147862fa-2698-11e7-8f95-9b463953f2de.jpg)\n\n($\\rho$ is the density sampled by the numerical scheme, and $\\pi$ is the exact target density.\nEach column illustrates an increasing finite timestep $\\Delta t$, below the \"stability threshold.\"\nRows 2 and 4 illustrate error in the sampled joint distribution, and rows 1 and 3 illustrate error in the sampled $\\mathbf{x}$-marginal distribution.)\n\nThe two schemes have the same computational cost per iteration, and introduce nearly identical levels of error into the sampled joint $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v})$ distribution -- but one of these methods introduces about 100x more error in the $\\mathbf{x}$ marginal than the other at large timesteps!\n\n### Toy implementation\nTo illustrate the scheme, here is a toy Python implementation for each of the explicit updates:\n```python\n# Defined elsewhere: friction coefficient `gamma`, mass `m`\n\ndef propagate_R(x, v, h): \n    \"\"\"Linear \"drift\" -- deterministic position update\n    using current velocities\"\"\"\n    return (x + (h * v), v)\n\ndef propagate_V(x, v, h):\n    \"\"\"Linear \"kick\" -- deterministic velocity update\n    using current forces\"\"\"\n    return (x, v + (h * force(x) / m))\n\ndef propagate_O(x, v, h):\n    \"\"\"Ornstein-Uhlenbeck -- stochastic velocity update\n    using a ficticious \"heat-bath\"\"\"\"\n    a, b = exp(-gamma * h), sqrt(1 - exp(-2 * gamma * h))\n    return (x, (a * v) + b * draw_maxwell_boltzmann_velocities())\n\npropagate = {\"O\": propagate_O, \"R\": propagate_R, \"V\": propagate_V}\n```\nwhere `draw_maxwell_boltzmann_velocities()` draws an independent sample from the velocity distribution given by the masses and temperature.\n\nUsing the functions we just defined, here's how to implement the inner-loop of the scheme denoted `OVRVO`:\n```python\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt / 2)\n```\n\nAnd here's the `VRORV` inner-loop:\n```python\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_O(x, v, dt)\nx, v = propagate_R(x, v, dt / 2)\nx, v = propagate_V(x, v, dt / 2)\n```\n\nAs suggested from these examples, the generic recipe for turning a splitting string into a Langevin integrator is:\n\n```python\ndef get_n(substep=\"O\", splitting=\"OVRVO\"):\n    return sum([s == substep for s in splitting])\n\ndef simulate_timestep(x, v, dt, splitting=\"OVRVO\"):\n    for substep in splitting:\n        x, v = propagate[substep](x, v, dt / get_n(substep, splitting))\n    return x, v\n```\n\n# Systematically enumerating numerical schemes and measuring their error\nIn this repository, we enumerate numerical schemes for Langevin dynamics by associating strings over the alphabet `{O, R, V}` with explicit numerical methods using [OpenMM `CustomIntegrator`](http://docs.openmm.org/7.1.0/userguide/theory.html#customintegrator)s. We provide schemes for approximating the error introduced by that method in the sampled distribution over $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{v}) jointly or $\\mathbf{x}$ alone using nonequilibrium work theorems.\nWe further investigate the effects of modifying the mass matrix (aka \"hydrogen mass repartitioning\") and/or evaluating subsets of the forces per substep (aka \"multi-timestep\" methods, obtained by expanding the alphabet to `{O, R, V0, V1, ..., V32}`).\n\n(TODO: Details on nonequilibrium error measurement scheme.)\n\n## Relation to prior work\nWe did not introduce the concept of splitting the Langevin system into these three \"building blocks\" -- this decomposition is developed lucidly in Chapter 7 of [[Leimkuhler and Matthews, 2015]](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319163741). We also did not discover the `VRORV` integrator -- Leimkuhler and Matthews have studied the favorable properties of particular integrator `VRORV` (\"`BAOAB`\" in their notation) in great detail.\nHere, we have:\n1. provided a method to translate these strings into efficient `CustomIntegrators` in OpenMM,\n2. provided a uniform scheme for measuring the sampling error introduced by any member of this family of methods on any target density (approximating the KL divergence directly, rather than monitoring error in a system-specific choice of low-dimensional observable),\n3. considered an expanded alphabet, encompassing many widely-used variants as special cases.\n\n# References\n(TODO: Add references from paper!)"}, "SASfit/SASfit": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner":

repository contains all the analysis we had to do to be able to write the manuscript on the *Pulmonary acini exhibit complex changes during postnatal rat lung development*.\nA preprint of the manuscript can be found on bioRxiv with the DOI [10.1101/786681](https://doi.org/10.1101/786681).\nThe manuscript was submitted to the [American Journal of Physiology- Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology](https://journals.physiology.org/journal/ajplung).\n\nThe main calculations are done in [this Jupyter notebook](Analysis.ipynb) (a copy of which you can run in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the second badge above).\nSaid notebook also generates most of the figures (in Python it would be `figures[1:]`), which have been copied as PNG images to [the Authorea document](https://www.authorea.com/274247/47HwqAxume3L2xkLOsg_SQ) which we've edited collaboratively between all Co-Authors.\nSince Figure 1 was a bit more complicated, we generated it from the raw data with [its own Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/MicroscopyFigure.ipynb).\n\nThe other [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) and XLS sheets in this repository have been used for detail work in the manuscript or to quickly grasp what's in the raw data.\nThe [file `acinidavid.pzf`](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/acinidavid.pzf) is a file which Tiziana used for a preliminary analyis of the data in [Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).\n\nThe delineated datasets of the +700 acini that we used for the analyis can be provided on request (since they're too big/distrubuted to be shared directly online).\nA copy of the data extracted from these datasets is added to the repository as `Datafile_$githash.pkl`, so you technically don't need it to follow along with our results.\nThis should enable you to get exactly the same results as we did, e.g. do some [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).\n\nPlease get in touch with me if youd like to try, I'm happy to help!\nYou can either send me an [email](https://www.anatomie.unibe.ch/haberthu), [file an issue](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/issues) or use the 'chat on Gitter' badge on top to start a chat.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 124, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor":

repository contains all the analysis we had to do to be able to write the manuscript on the *Pulmonary acini exhibit complex changes during postnatal rat lung development*.\nA preprint of the manuscript can be found on bioRxiv with the DOI [10.1101/786681](https://doi.org/10.1101/786681).\nThe manuscript was submitted to the [American Journal of Physiology- Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology](https://journals.physiology.org/journal/ajplung).\n\nThe main calculations are done in [this Jupyter notebook](Analysis.ipynb) (a copy of which you can run in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the second badge above).\nSaid notebook also generates most of the figures (in Python it would be `figures[1:]`), which have been copied as PNG images to [the Authorea document](https://www.authorea.com/274247/47HwqAxume3L2xkLOsg_SQ) which we've edited collaboratively between all Co-Authors.\nSince Figure 1 was a bit more complicated, we generated it from the raw data with [its own Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/MicroscopyFigure.ipynb).\n\nThe other [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) and XLS sheets in this repository have been used for detail work in the manuscript or to quickly grasp what's in the raw data.\nThe [file `acinidavid.pzf`](https://github.com/habi/acinar-analysis/blob/master/acinidavid.pzf) is a file which Tiziana used for a preliminary analyis of the data in [Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).\n\nThe delineated datasets of the +700 acini that we used for the analyis can be provided on request (since they're too big/distrubuted to be shared directly online).\nA copy of the data extracted from these datasets is added to the repository as `Datafile_$githash.pkl`, so you technically don't need it to follow along with our results.\nThis should enable you to get exactly the same results as we did, e.g. do some [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).\n\nPlease get in touch with me if youd like to try, I'm happy to help!\nYou can either send me an [email](https://www.anatomie.unibe.ch/haberthu), [file an issue](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/issues) or

"object": {"text": "# Ambiguity\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator)\n\nThis is a Haskell library to expose the \"ambiguous random value generator\". The mathematical and practical properties of this generator are available in our paper which you can find here: https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n\nWe would be grateful if you would cite us in work that uses this ambiguity generator. We have provided the BibTeX infno here:\n\n```\n@article{AmbiguityInTheLabMS2011,\nauthor = {Jack Stecher and Timothy Shields and John Dickhaut},\ntitle = {Generating Ambiguity in the Laboratory},\njournal = {Management Science},\nvolume = {57},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {705-712},\nyear = {2011},\ndoi = {10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307},\n\nURL = {\n        https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n   \n},\neprint = {\n        https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n   \n}\n```\n\nthis info is also available in the `ambiguity.bib` file, if you prefer.\n\n# Trying out the Ambiguity Generator\n\nThere is a website where you can try out the ambiguity generator here:\n\nhttps://ambiguity.typesofnote.com/\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install the AmbiguityGenerator using the source code. You will\nneed Haskell for the install. We recommend using\n[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) which will be\nable to fetch the Haskell compiler for you.\n\nAfter installing stack you should fetch the source code:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator.git\n\nOnce you have the source code, enter the directory and build the\napplications using stack:\n\n    cd AmbiguityGenerator\n    stack build\n\nIf you want to install the applications locally you can also use:\n\n    stack install\n\nBy default this will install the packages in `~/.local/bin`, so you\nwill need to add that to your PATH.\n\nIf you just use `stack build` you can run the programs using `stack\nexec`, which we'll use in the following examples.\n\n# Histogram and Graph Generation\n\nThere's an application for generating graphs of realizations, and\nhistograms of the draws under finite support. It can be run as\nfollows:\n\n    stack exec histogram <runs> <samples> <range> <output-file>\n\n- `<runs>` should be replaced with the number of simulations you wish to run.\n- `<samples>` is the number of draws from the ambiguity generator.\n- `<range>` is a number for the range of finite support values. E.g., `10` will be 0 to 9.\n- `<output-file>` is the name of the output file. Something like `graphs.svg` will be good.\n\nThe code for this is in the `app/` directory.\n\n# Generating Draws\n\nIf you just want to generate a bunch of CSV files of ambiguous data,\nyou can use the `draws` program:\n\n    stack exec draws <runs> <samples> <file-base>\n\n- `<runs>` should be replaced with the number of simulations you wish to run.\n- `<samples>` is the number of draws from the ambiguity generator.\n- `<file-base>` is the string at the start of the output file.\n\nThis will generate a number of CSV files in the current directory of the forms:\n\n- `<fileBase><samples>-bits-<run>.csv`: coin flips.\n- `<fileBase><samples>-digits-<run>.csv`: values from 0 to 9.\n- `<fileBase><samples>-ambiguous-<run>.csv`: raw realizations.\n\nThe code for this program is in the `draws/` directory.\n\n# Web Server\n\nThere is a web application which allows users to download CSV files of\ncertain draws. Additionally this server hosts an API that can be used\nto get output from the ambiguity generator in a JSON format.\n\n    stack exec ambiguity-server 8080\n\nWill run the web server on port 8080. You can then view the website by\ngoing to: http://localhost:8080\n\nThe code for the web server is in the `web/` directory.\n\n# Library\n\nThe ambiguity generator library is in `src/`.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 69, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "2376ecfcc65c39468dfccebc02c448e2ff1572b1 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Calvin Beck", "email": "hobbes@ualberta.ca", "date": "2019-07-16T19:11:07-04:00"}, "pushedDate": "2019-07-16T23:13:54Z", "messageHeadline": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator"}}, {"node": {"additions": 21, "author": {"name": "Calvin Beck", "email": "hobbes@ualberta.ca", "date": "2019-07-16T19:10:50-04:00"}, "pushedDate": null, "messageHeadline": "Bump versions.

The mathematical and practical properties of this generator are available in our paper which you can find here: https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n\nWe would be grateful if you would cite us in work that uses this ambiguity generator. We have provided the BibTeX infno here:\n\n```\n@article{AmbiguityInTheLabMS2011,\nauthor = {Jack Stecher and Timothy Shields and John Dickhaut},\ntitle = {Generating Ambiguity in the Laboratory},\njournal = {Management Science},\nvolume = {57},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {705-712},\nyear = {2011},\ndoi = {10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307},\n\nURL = {\n        https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n   \n},\neprint = {\n        https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1307\n   \n}\n```\n\nthis info is also available in the `ambiguity.bib` file, if you prefer.\n\n# Trying out the Ambiguity Generator\n\nThere is a website where you can try out the ambiguity generator here:\n\nhttps://ambiguity.typesofnote.com/\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install the AmbiguityGenerator using the source code. You will\nneed Haskell for the install. We recommend using\n[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) which will be\nable to fetch the Haskell compiler for you.\n\nAfter installing stack you should fetch the source code:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/HaskellAmbiguity/AmbiguityGenerator.git\n\nOnce you have the source code, enter the directory and build the\napplications using stack:\n\n    cd AmbiguityGenerator\n    stack build\n\nIf you want to install the applications locally you can also use:\n\n    stack install\n\nBy default this will install the packages in `~/.local/bin`, so you\nwill need to add that to your PATH.\n\nIf you just use `stack build` you can run the programs using `stack\nexec`, which we'll use in the following examples.\n\n# Histogram and Graph Generation\n\nThere's an application for generating graphs of realizations, and\nhistograms of the draws under finite support. It can be run as\nfollows:\n\n    stack exec histogram <runs> <samples> <range> <output-file>\n\n- `<runs>` should be replaced with the number of simulations you wish to run.\n- `<samples>` is the number of draws from the ambiguity generator.\n- `<range>` is a number for the range of finite support values. E.g., `10` will be 0 to 9.\n- `<output-file>` is the name of the output file. Something like `graphs.svg` will be good.\n\nThe code for this is in the `app/` directory.\n\n# Generating Draws\n\nIf you just want to generate a bunch of CSV files of ambiguous data,\nyou can use the `draws` program:\n\n    stack exec draws <runs> <samples> <file-base>\n\n- `<runs>` should be replaced with the number of simulations you wish to run.\n- `<samples>` is the number of draws from the ambiguity generator.\n- `<file-base>` is the string at the start of the output file.\n\nThis will generate a number of CSV files in the current directory of the forms:\n\n- `<fileBase><samples>-bits-<run>.csv`: coin flips.\n- `<fileBase><samples>-digits-<run>.csv`: values from 0 to 9.\n- `<fileBase><samples>-ambiguous-<run>.csv`: raw realizations.\n\nThe code for this program is in the `draws/` directory.\n\n# Web Server\n\nThere is a web application which allows users to download CSV files of\ncertain draws. Additionally this server hosts an API that can be used\nto get output from the ambiguity generator in a JSON format.\n\n    stack exec ambiguity-server 8080\n\nWill run the web server on port 8080. You can then view the website by\ngoing to: http://localhost:8080\n\nThe code for the web server is in the `web/` directory.\n\n# Library\n\nThe ambiguity generator library is in `src/`.\n"}, "zbw/cdv2018-pressemappe20": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "zbw/cdv2018-pressemappe20", "diskUsage": 149, "name": "cdv2018-pressemappe20", "owner": {"login": "zbw"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2018-09-06T18:18:39Z", "pushedAt": "2018-11-16T15:55:59Z", "object": {"text": "# Pressemappe 20.

\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe pattern of molecular evolution varies among gene sites and genes in a genome. By taking into account the complex heterogeneity of evolutionary processes among sites in a genome, Bayesian infinite mixturemodels of genomic evolution enable robust phylogenetic inference. With large modern data sets, however,the computational burden of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques becomes prohibitive. Here, we have developed a variational Bayesian procedure to speed up the widely used PhyloBayes MPI program, which deals with the heterogeneity of amino acid propensity. Rather than sampling from the posterior distribution, the procedure approximates the (unknown) posterior distribution using a manageable distribution called the variational distribution. The parameters in the variational distribution are estimated by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. To examine performance, we analyzed three large data sets consisting of mitochondrial, plastid-encoded, and nuclear proteins. Our variational method accurately approximated the Bayesian phylogenetic tree, mixture proportions, and the amino acid propensity of each component of the mixture while using orders of magnitude less computational time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis package implements a scalable, parallel implementation of the fast algorithm for fitting \na model of biological computation on large data set. \n\nNote: All files have name like \"....VI.h/cpp\" which we have updated new optimization algorithm for computating the parameters of model\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 124, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor":

\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe pattern of molecular evolution varies among gene sites and genes in a genome. By taking into account the complex heterogeneity of evolutionary processes among sites in a genome, Bayesian infinite mixturemodels of genomic evolution enable robust phylogenetic inference. With large modern data sets, however,the computational burden of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques becomes prohibitive. Here, we have developed a variational Bayesian procedure to speed up the widely used PhyloBayes MPI program, which deals with the heterogeneity of amino acid propensity. Rather than sampling from the posterior distribution, the procedure approximates the (unknown) posterior distribution using a manageable distribution called the variational distribution. The parameters in the variational distribution are estimated by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. To examine performance, we analyzed three large data sets consisting of mitochondrial, plastid-encoded, and nuclear proteins. Our variational method accurately approximated the Bayesian phylogenetic tree, mixture proportions, and the amino acid propensity of each component of the mixture while using orders of magnitude less computational time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis package implements a scalable, parallel implementation of the fast algorithm for fitting \na model of biological computation on large data set. \n\nNote: All files have name like \"....VI.h/cpp\" which we have updated new optimization algorithm for computating the parameters of model\n"}, "elap2/ICU-Patient-Admission-Prediction-Covid-19-": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "elap2/ICU-Patient-Admission-Prediction-Covid-19-", "diskUsage": 505, "name": "ICU-Patient-Admission-Prediction-Covid-19-", "owner": {"login": "elap2"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "C#"}]}, "createdAt": "2020-04-07T18:54:34Z", "pushedAt": "2020-04-25T08:18:28Z", "object": {"text": "- En Espa\u00f1ol haga click [aqu\u00ed](#predicci\u00f3n-de-la-admisi\u00f3n-de-pacientes-covid)\n\n- Clicken Sie auf [Deutsch](#berechnung-der-covid-patienten-aufnahme-auf-icu) \n\n# ICU-Patient-Admission-Prediction-Covid-19+\nTo do an estimation of how many patients are being admitted to the intensive care unit or acute care patients is essential for hospital planning during the period of NPI (Non-Pharmacological Interventions) and also during their release (Lockdown Release).

or acute care patients is essential for hospital planning during the period of NPI (Non-Pharmacological Interventions) and also during their release (Lockdown Release). For this purpose the doubling time is an essential parameter.\n\nThis App created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 is a Console App (.NET Core) written in C sharp.

The ConsoleApp1 (faster) does not include the percentage of ICU beds needed due to NON-COVID-19+ Patients (unlike from https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762). \n \n# Run this App doing the following steps: \n### 1. Clone or Download all the files into one folder. \n### 2. Go to the folder [\\Application](https://github.com/elap2/ICU-Patient-Admission-Prediction-Covid-19-/tree/master/Application) and run ConsoleApp1.exe within e.g. *C:\\YourDownloadPath*\\Application\\ConsoleApp1.exe\n\n> The source code is the file Program.cs at

need to be online* \n- *It is straight forward and it's output gives you the number of patients admitted to the hospital, to the ICU, to the AC (acute care beds during the days projected)*\n\n# Ouput

Minisat was always slower, Walksat did not find solutions.\n\nInput for the SAT solver was created with [Naoyuki Tamura](http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/tamura.html) [research](http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/research.html)'s Sugar program:\n\n* [Sugar](http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/sugar/)\n\n\n4.

I\u2019m not sure if the way I added noise from the Laplace mechanism was differentially private or not. I think we should either remove the parts about formal privacy from the intro or add an explanation in the last section about how we can now say that our database is mathematically sound against a DRA."}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 191, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "d5f6f60a4c9528ee7cd65f5b7f3bdae65b6add8e 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 0, "author": {"name": "Anonymous", "email": "anonymous@overleaf.com", "date": "2018-09-26T11:20:20Z"}, "pushedDate": "2019-12-02T14:09:49Z", "messageHeadline": "Update on Overleaf.", "message": "Update on Overleaf."}}, {"node": {"additions": 11, "author": {"name": "Simson L.

SMALL-LABS\r\n\r\nThe SMALL-LABS (Single-Molecule Accurate Localization by Local Background Subtraction) algorithm, accurately locates and measures the intensity of single molecules, regardless of the shape or brightness of the background.\r\n\r\nThe program can also fit single molecules without doing background subtraction. See the User Guide for more details.\r\n\r\nWritten by Benjamin P Isaacoff at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is described in B.P. Isaacoff, Y. Li, S.A. Lee and J.S. Biteen, \u201cSMALL-LABS: An algorithm for measuring single-molecule intensity and position in the presence of obscuring backgrounds,\u201d _Biophysical Journal_, in press (**2019**). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2019.02.006\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the entire folder and unzip if you downloaded the .zip folder. Change the working directory in Matlab to this folder and call the functions in the Matlab command window as described in the User Guide.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSee the Quick Start Guide for a quick introduction to using *SMALLLABS_main*. \r\n\r\nSee the User Guide for the details. Briefly, the function *SMALLLABS_main* is a wrapper for the other code to perform all of the steps in the correct order. Simply run *SMALLLABS_main* by specifying the directory containing your movies, specify the three required parameters, and any optional parameters, then run it and click to choose the movies you want to fit. Or run the various programs independently.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease inform us (isaacoff@umich.edu) before making any changes, then follow the directions below: \r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2.

Complile ```BLOCK```\n\n```BLOCK``` requires BLAS, LAPACK and BOOST.\nMPI library is needed for distributed-memory parallel compilation.\n```BLOCK``` is compiled using the makefile supplied in the distribution. \nThe following customizations need to be made to the makefile placed in the main directory ```./Block```. \n\nChoose compilers by specifying,\n\n\tCXX = g++  \n\nFor MPI-based parallel execution on distributed-memory machines,\n  \n        USE_MPI = yes\n        MPICXX = mpicxx  \n\nMPI library must be compiled using the same compiler as for compiling ```BLOCK```. \nIntel compiler such as ```icpc``` is also supported with approriate compiling flags chosen automatically.\n\nTo enable MKL library,\n\n        USE_MKL = yes\n\nAnd supply MKL and BOOST libraries by giving the locations,\n    \n\tMKLLIB = /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.0.080/mkl/lib/intel64/ \n\tMKLFLAGS = /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.0.080/mkl/include\n\n\tBOOSTLIB = /lib64/boost_1_55_0/lib/\n\tBOOSTINCLUDE = /lib64/boost_1_55_0/include/\n\nWhen the makefile is configured, run in the directory ```./Block```\n\n        $./make\n\nThe successful compilation generates the executable ```block.spin_adapted```, static and shared DMRG libraries ```libqcdmrg.a``` and ```libqcdmrg.so```.\n\n### 2. Test ```BLOCK```\n\n```BLOCK``` can be tested by executing the script in the directory ```./Block/dmrg_tests```,\n\n        $cd dmrg_tests\n        $./runtest\n\nThe tests require Python to be installed on the system.\n\n### 3. Run ```BLOCK```\n\nThe standalone serial code can be executed running\n\n        $block.spin_adapted input.dat > output.dat\n\n```input.dat``` is the input file and the output of the program is piped into the output file ```output.dat```.\n\nThe MPI parallel mode can be called running\n\n        $mpirun -np 4 block.spin_adapted input.dat > output.dat\n\nHow to cite `Block`\n-------------------\n\n`Block` is distributed under the GNU GPL license which is reproduced in the file LICENSE.\nIn addition, `Block` contains a full copy of the Newmat C++ matrix library by Robert Davies.\n\nWe would appreciate if you cite the following papers in publications resulting from the\nuse of `Block`:\n\n* G. K.-L. Chan and M. Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys. 116, 4462 (2002),\n* G. K.-L. Chan, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 3172 (2004),\n* D. Ghosh, J. Hachmann, T. Yanai, and G. K.-L. Chan, J. Chem.

Complile ```BLOCK```\n\n```BLOCK``` requires BLAS, LAPACK and BOOST.\nMPI library is needed for distributed-memory parallel compilation.\n```BLOCK``` is compiled using the makefile supplied in the distribution. \nThe following customizations need to be made to the makefile placed in the main directory ```./Block```. \n\nChoose compilers by specifying,\n\n\tCXX = g++  \n\nFor MPI-based parallel execution on distributed-memory machines,\n  \n        USE_MPI = yes\n        MPICXX = mpicxx  \n\nMPI library must be compiled using the same compiler as for compiling ```BLOCK```. \nIntel compiler such as ```icpc``` is also supported with approriate compiling flags chosen automatically.\n\nTo enable MKL library,\n\n        USE_MKL = yes\n\nAnd supply MKL and BOOST libraries by giving the locations,\n    \n\tMKLLIB = /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.0.080/mkl/lib/intel64/ \n\tMKLFLAGS = /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.0.080/mkl/include\n\n\tBOOSTLIB = /lib64/boost_1_55_0/lib/\n\tBOOSTINCLUDE = /lib64/boost_1_55_0/include/\n\nWhen the makefile is configured, run in the directory ```./Block```\n\n        $./make\n\nThe successful compilation generates the executable ```block.spin_adapted```, static and shared DMRG libraries ```libqcdmrg.a``` and ```libqcdmrg.so```.\n\n### 2. Test ```BLOCK```\n\n```BLOCK``` can be tested by executing the script in the directory ```./Block/dmrg_tests```,\n\n        $cd dmrg_tests\n        $./runtest\n\nThe tests require Python to be installed on the system.\n\n### 3. Run ```BLOCK```\n\nThe standalone serial code can be executed running\n\n        $block.spin_adapted input.dat > output.dat\n\n```input.dat``` is the input file and the output of the program is piped into the output file ```output.dat```.\n\nThe MPI parallel mode can be called running\n\n        $mpirun -np 4 block.spin_adapted input.dat > output.dat\n\nHow to cite `Block`\n-------------------\n\n`Block` is distributed under the GNU GPL license which is reproduced in the file LICENSE.\nIn addition, `Block` contains a full copy of the Newmat C++ matrix library by Robert Davies.\n\nWe would appreciate if you cite the following papers in publications resulting from the\nuse of `Block`:\n\n* G.

This analysis approach was initially designed to tackle complex *Cyclospora cayetanensis* genotyping datasets, though we are currently applying these algorithms to other genotyping challenges. This method constitutes a type of unsupervised [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and was developed to adress three issues: (1) the common occurrence of missing data in genotyping datasets (e.g. such as a situation where 2 or 3 out of 6 MLST markers fail to amplify for a subset of your specimens), (2) the use of MLST methods in the context of sexually reproducing populations, where even closely related individuals may not possess the same genotype (and may be heterozygous) due to chromosomal crossover and random reassortment of chromosomes as occurs during meiosis and, (3) the issue of analyzing specimens which may be extremely complex, potentially representing mixed populations of individuals. Ever try to construct a phylogeny or generate a cluster dendrogram in a situation where for one MLST marker you detect one haplotype, at another you detect three, at another you detect four and another you detect two - in the same specimen? This is essentially what we deal with when we attempt to genotype *Cyclospora cayetanensis* directly from human stool. It gets extremely complicated.\n\nUsing the \"Eukaryotyping\" method you do not need to exclude specimens with a partial genotype (within reason). For example, if you have a large MLST dataset where some specimens have only half of their MLST markers successfully sequenced, this method will usually cope just fine provided the markers that were successfully sequenced are sufficiently diverse. If you have a complex dataset where some specimens are heterozygous or homozygous at any marker, this method will also cope just fine. Even if your dataset represents a population of mixed genotypes (i.e., such as a stool specimen containing a set of haplotypes representing a sexually reproducing population of *Cyclospora*), this method should cope just fine. The end result is a distance matrix where the values (all between 0 and 1) represent how closely related every possible pair of specimens is. A value of \"0\" indicates that the specimens are identical, and a value of \"1\" indicates the specimens are not related.\n\n## Using these scripts\nThe R scripts provided here constitute the \"Eukaryotyping\" R code that was initially prepared for analysis of our complex *Cyclospora cayetanensis* genotyping data. These files were written by Dr Mateusz Plucinski who is a co-author of the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182019000581) that first describes the algorithms.\n\n#### Importing data\nFive files are provided here (six if you include the README file). One of these files (import_data_V2.r) must be modified by the user depending on how the user wishes the haplotypes to be defined, and depending on the name of the file/data sheet containing the haplotype data. An example of how the haplotype data sheet must be formatted is provided in this file: \"Example_haplotype_data_sheet.txt\". This format must be adhered to or the scripts will not run correctly. The names of the markers used can be changed by the end user, but the format must not change.\n\n#### Naming markers\nThe names of the markers (i.e., the \"locinames\" variable) must be modified in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script (around line 6) according to a system defined by the user. For example, if the user has several large genes/loci that they wish to split into smaller parts, there is the option to do so by defining them as GENE_1_PART_A, GENE_1_PART_B, GENE_1_PART_C etc.., and the base name (i.e., the locinames_base variable - around line 9) of this marker is then defined as \"GENE_1\" (take a look at \"import_data_V2.r\" and you will get the idea). If the end user does not wish to divide a given marker (e.g. \"MARKER_Z\") into sub-markers, then the base name is simply \"MARKER_Z\" - the same as the \"locinames\" variable. Ultimately, it is the end user that develops a system for defining haplotypes that best suits their purpose.\n\n#### Caveats for dividing markers into smaller parts\nThere are some caveats that must be considered when dividing up markers in the way described above, and this would depend on the entropy of the marker and the number of markers being examined. Ultimately, if the marker is incredibly hypervariable (e.g., lets say, there are 50 haplotypes in your population of 60 specimens), very few links will be identified at this locus by the algorithms. In this case, the end user may wish to add additional markers possessing fewer haplotypes (i.e., markers of a lower entropy, possessing 5 to 20 haplotypes or so), or split this hypervariable locus into smaller pieces such that the number of haplotypes at each piece is drastically reduced. Alternatively, the end user may wish to exclude such hypervariable markers from their analysis.\n\n#### Defining the ploidy of each marker\nThe user also needs to define the ploidy of each marker in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script - around line 11. For example, if your markers are mitochondrial, then you would indicate \"1\" for the ploidy as the mitochondrial genome is inherited via an extranuclear mechanism. If your organism is a sexually reproducing eukaryote with 2N chromosomes, any nuclear/chromosomal loci must have their ploidy set to \"2\". The ploidy must be defined for all markers previously included in the \"locinames\" variable (and in the same order) in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script (not in the the same order as the base names - if you do this for only the base names, the script will fail to run). The scripts provided here require ***a combination*** of nuclear and mitochondrial markers in order to run correctly.\n\n#### Filtering to exclude specimens with insufficient data\nWhile the \"Eukaryotyping\" ensemble does a good job at compensating for specimens with partial data (e.g., where not all markers in a given MLST panel were succesfully sequenced for a subset of specimens), the end user may wish to set a cutoff for the minimum amount of data required before a specimen is excluded from the analysis completely. The user can set very specific inclusion criteria by providing a set of filtering parameters for their genotyping dataset. This information is contained in the \"cleandata\" variable within the \"import_data_V2.r\" script - around line 54. This variable will define the inclusion criteria for your specimens. For instance, if 1 out of 8 typing markers was successfully sequenced for a given specimen, you may wish to exclude that specimen as this is not enough information to perform an classification and assign that specimen to the correct cluster. You may wish to only include specimens that sequenced successfully for at least markers 1, 2 and 8, plus at least one other marker, or only include specimens that sequenced for at least markers 1 to 4. These combinations are up to the user to determine. When modified correctly, the script will automatically exclude specimens that fail to meet the criteria defined. Note that these loci are defined numerically, and these numbers correspond to the precise order the markers are listed in, within the \"locinames_base\" variable of the \"import_data_V2.r\" (around line 9).\n\n### Determining an epsilon value for Plucinski's [naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier \nNext, the user might consider modifying the \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" script to provide a user-defined epsilon value. This value reflects the rate of missing data, or how often markers or haplotypes that ***should*** be present in a specimen are not detected due to amplification and/or sequencing failures, or insufficient depth in the case of deep sequencing experiments. We determined this value to be 0.3072 based on a series of deep amplicon sequencing (Illumina) experiments, performed on a large *Cyclospora* dataset, considering 8 genotyping markers. The user is open to run the algorithm using this epsilon value (this will possibly/probably provide a sensible answer), or the user may wish to run experiments to determine this value for their own dataset. For the sake of accuracy, we recommend that users determine an epsilon value that is optimised for their dataset. To set a value for epsilon prior to running an analysis, modify the R script \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" at line 33.\n\n### Starting the analysis\nOnce the \"import_data_V2.r\" and  \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" are modified by the user to reflect their data, calculation of two matrices by each algorithm is commenced by running the script \"run.r\". This script first initiates the importation of data using the \"import_data_V2.r\" script. Next, calculation of the Bayesian matrix is initiated by \"run.r\" which runs the script \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\". This is the Bayesian algorithm developed by Dr Mateusz Plucinski. Once the Bayesian matrix is calculated, the \"run.r\" script then initiates calculation of the heuristic matrix by running the script:  \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\". This script executes the heuristic algorithm developed by Dr Joel Barratt, which constitutes a novel clustering procedure, probably a kind of [mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) that performs an [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) task. The script called \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\" does not need to be modified by the end user at any point (unless the user wishes to change the number of cores used to run the script in parallel - see below). It may seem obvious, but please ensure that all scripts and the necessary haplotype data sheet are in the same directory or the scripts will not function correctly.\n\n### Output\nThese scripts will generate three csv files: the Bayesian matrix, the heuristic matrix, and the ensemble matrix. In the first description of this algorithm (see Supplementary material 1 - located [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/genotyping-genetically-heterogeneous-cyclospora-cayetanensis-infections-to-complement-epidemiological-case-linkage/0C51FBFFB172DF50357C1D171E9B8657#fndtn-supplementary-materials)), the output values of the Bayesian matrix and the heuristic matrix were simply averaged to generate the ensemble matrix. However, we later found that the predictive value of this method was improved using an alternative normalization approach. This improved approach involves mapping the distribution of distances generated by the Bayesian algorithm to the empiric distribution of distances generated by the heuristic algorithm. The mean of these mapped pairs is then used to generate the final ensemble matrix of pairwise distances. The scripts provided here perform the latter (i.e., improved) normalization procedure.\n\n### Visualisation\nFinally, the ensemble matrix is clustered and visualized as a dendrogram (or some other way). We prefer to use Wards clustering method and Manhattan distances, as described in the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182019000581). We have also enjoyed using [MicrobeTrace](https://microbetrace.herokuapp.com), which is a great tool for visualization of paired distance tables and matrices, developed by [Tony Boyles](https://github.com/aaboyles).\n\n### Parallelization\nParts of two of these scripts have been parallelized to reduce the time of computation: \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" and \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\". The number of cores used for each of these scripts is currently set to 12 and this setting should be adjusted depending on resources avaible on the users system. The setting can be adjusted for the \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" script at around line 123. For the \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\" script, this setting can be adjusted at around line 96.\n\n### Notes\nTheoretically, the more specimens from your population included in the analysis, and the more markers analyzed, the more accurate the clustering should be. This is a pop-gen tool and works best when many members of your test population are represented in the dataset. We are currently performing experiments to determine the optimal sample sizes and other factors that impact the acuracy of clustering.\n\n***IMPORTANT: These scripts will not run correctly in R console or R studio. Run them in a terminal window only.***\n\n### License agreement\nThe manuscript describing this method and the scripts provided here have been distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the same Creative Commons licence is included and the original work is properly cited.\n\n### If you make use of these files and find our work helpful, please don't forget to cite us:\n\n```Barratt, JLN, S Park, FS Nascimento, J Hofstetter, M Plucinski, S Casillas, RS Bradbury, MJ Arrowood, Y Qvarnstrom, E Talundzic (2019) Genotyping genetically heterogeneous Cyclospora cayetanensis infections to complement epidemiological case linkage.

described by Barratt, Park and colleagues in the manuscript that can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182019000581).\n\n\"Eukaryotyping\" refers to the analysis performed using the ensemble of similarity-based classification algorithms developed by Dr Mateusz Plucinski and Dr Joel Barratt. This analysis approach was initially designed to tackle complex *Cyclospora cayetanensis* genotyping datasets, though we are currently applying these algorithms to other genotyping challenges. This method constitutes a type of unsupervised [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and was developed to adress three issues: (1) the common occurrence of missing data in genotyping datasets (e.g. such as a situation where 2 or 3 out of 6 MLST markers fail to amplify for a subset of your specimens), (2) the use of MLST methods in the context of sexually reproducing populations, where even closely related individuals may not possess the same genotype (and may be heterozygous) due to chromosomal crossover and random reassortment of chromosomes as occurs during meiosis and, (3) the issue of analyzing specimens which may be extremely complex, potentially representing mixed populations of individuals. Ever try to construct a phylogeny or generate a cluster dendrogram in a situation where for one MLST marker you detect one haplotype, at another you detect three, at another you detect four and another you detect two - in the same specimen? This is essentially what we deal with when we attempt to genotype *Cyclospora cayetanensis* directly from human stool. It gets extremely complicated.\n\nUsing the \"Eukaryotyping\" method you do not need to exclude specimens with a partial genotype (within reason). For example, if you have a large MLST dataset where some specimens have only half of their MLST markers successfully sequenced, this method will usually cope just fine provided the markers that were successfully sequenced are sufficiently diverse. If you have a complex dataset where some specimens are heterozygous or homozygous at any marker, this method will also cope just fine. Even if your dataset represents a population of mixed genotypes (i.e., such as a stool specimen containing a set of haplotypes representing a sexually reproducing population of *Cyclospora*), this method should cope just fine. The end result is a distance matrix where the values (all between 0 and 1) represent how closely related every possible pair of specimens is. A value of \"0\" indicates that the specimens are identical, and a value of \"1\" indicates the specimens are not related.\n\n## Using these scripts\nThe R scripts provided here constitute the \"Eukaryotyping\" R code that was initially prepared for analysis of our complex *Cyclospora cayetanensis* genotyping data. These files were written by Dr Mateusz Plucinski who is a co-author of the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182019000581) that first describes the algorithms.\n\n#### Importing data\nFive files are provided here (six if you include the README file). One of these files (import_data_V2.r) must be modified by the user depending on how the user wishes the haplotypes to be defined, and depending on the name of the file/data sheet containing the haplotype data. An example of how the haplotype data sheet must be formatted is provided in this file: \"Example_haplotype_data_sheet.txt\". This format must be adhered to or the scripts will not run correctly. The names of the markers used can be changed by the end user, but the format must not change.\n\n#### Naming markers\nThe names of the markers (i.e., the \"locinames\" variable) must be modified in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script (around line 6) according to a system defined by the user. For example, if the user has several large genes/loci that they wish to split into smaller parts, there is the option to do so by defining them as GENE_1_PART_A, GENE_1_PART_B, GENE_1_PART_C etc.., and the base name (i.e., the locinames_base variable - around line 9) of this marker is then defined as \"GENE_1\" (take a look at \"import_data_V2.r\" and you will get the idea). If the end user does not wish to divide a given marker (e.g. \"MARKER_Z\") into sub-markers, then the base name is simply \"MARKER_Z\" - the same as the \"locinames\" variable. Ultimately, it is the end user that develops a system for defining haplotypes that best suits their purpose.\n\n#### Caveats for dividing markers into smaller parts\nThere are some caveats that must be considered when dividing up markers in the way described above, and this would depend on the entropy of the marker and the number of markers being examined. Ultimately, if the marker is incredibly hypervariable (e.g., lets say, there are 50 haplotypes in your population of 60 specimens), very few links will be identified at this locus by the algorithms. In this case, the end user may wish to add additional markers possessing fewer haplotypes (i.e., markers of a lower entropy, possessing 5 to 20 haplotypes or so), or split this hypervariable locus into smaller pieces such that the number of haplotypes at each piece is drastically reduced. Alternatively, the end user may wish to exclude such hypervariable markers from their analysis.\n\n#### Defining the ploidy of each marker\nThe user also needs to define the ploidy of each marker in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script - around line 11. For example, if your markers are mitochondrial, then you would indicate \"1\" for the ploidy as the mitochondrial genome is inherited via an extranuclear mechanism. If your organism is a sexually reproducing eukaryote with 2N chromosomes, any nuclear/chromosomal loci must have their ploidy set to \"2\". The ploidy must be defined for all markers previously included in the \"locinames\" variable (and in the same order) in the \"import_data_V2.r\" script (not in the the same order as the base names - if you do this for only the base names, the script will fail to run). The scripts provided here require ***a combination*** of nuclear and mitochondrial markers in order to run correctly.\n\n#### Filtering to exclude specimens with insufficient data\nWhile the \"Eukaryotyping\" ensemble does a good job at compensating for specimens with partial data (e.g., where not all markers in a given MLST panel were succesfully sequenced for a subset of specimens), the end user may wish to set a cutoff for the minimum amount of data required before a specimen is excluded from the analysis completely. The user can set very specific inclusion criteria by providing a set of filtering parameters for their genotyping dataset. This information is contained in the \"cleandata\" variable within the \"import_data_V2.r\" script - around line 54. This variable will define the inclusion criteria for your specimens. For instance, if 1 out of 8 typing markers was successfully sequenced for a given specimen, you may wish to exclude that specimen as this is not enough information to perform an classification and assign that specimen to the correct cluster. You may wish to only include specimens that sequenced successfully for at least markers 1, 2 and 8, plus at least one other marker, or only include specimens that sequenced for at least markers 1 to 4. These combinations are up to the user to determine. When modified correctly, the script will automatically exclude specimens that fail to meet the criteria defined. Note that these loci are defined numerically, and these numbers correspond to the precise order the markers are listed in, within the \"locinames_base\" variable of the \"import_data_V2.r\" (around line 9).\n\n### Determining an epsilon value for Plucinski's [naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier \nNext, the user might consider modifying the \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" script to provide a user-defined epsilon value. This value reflects the rate of missing data, or how often markers or haplotypes that ***should*** be present in a specimen are not detected due to amplification and/or sequencing failures, or insufficient depth in the case of deep sequencing experiments. We determined this value to be 0.3072 based on a series of deep amplicon sequencing (Illumina) experiments, performed on a large *Cyclospora* dataset, considering 8 genotyping markers. The user is open to run the algorithm using this epsilon value (this will possibly/probably provide a sensible answer), or the user may wish to run experiments to determine this value for their own dataset. For the sake of accuracy, we recommend that users determine an epsilon value that is optimised for their dataset. To set a value for epsilon prior to running an analysis, modify the R script \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" at line 33.\n\n### Starting the analysis\nOnce the \"import_data_V2.r\" and  \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" are modified by the user to reflect their data, calculation of two matrices by each algorithm is commenced by running the script \"run.r\". This script first initiates the importation of data using the \"import_data_V2.r\" script. Next, calculation of the Bayesian matrix is initiated by \"run.r\" which runs the script \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\". This is the Bayesian algorithm developed by Dr Mateusz Plucinski. Once the Bayesian matrix is calculated, the \"run.r\" script then initiates calculation of the heuristic matrix by running the script:  \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\". This script executes the heuristic algorithm developed by Dr Joel Barratt, which constitutes a novel clustering procedure, probably a kind of [mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) that performs an [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) task. The script called \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\" does not need to be modified by the end user at any point (unless the user wishes to change the number of cores used to run the script in parallel - see below). It may seem obvious, but please ensure that all scripts and the necessary haplotype data sheet are in the same directory or the scripts will not function correctly.\n\n### Output\nThese scripts will generate three csv files: the Bayesian matrix, the heuristic matrix, and the ensemble matrix. In the first description of this algorithm (see Supplementary material 1 - located [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/genotyping-genetically-heterogeneous-cyclospora-cayetanensis-infections-to-complement-epidemiological-case-linkage/0C51FBFFB172DF50357C1D171E9B8657#fndtn-supplementary-materials)), the output values of the Bayesian matrix and the heuristic matrix were simply averaged to generate the ensemble matrix. However, we later found that the predictive value of this method was improved using an alternative normalization approach. This improved approach involves mapping the distribution of distances generated by the Bayesian algorithm to the empiric distribution of distances generated by the heuristic algorithm. The mean of these mapped pairs is then used to generate the final ensemble matrix of pairwise distances. The scripts provided here perform the latter (i.e., improved) normalization procedure.\n\n### Visualisation\nFinally, the ensemble matrix is clustered and visualized as a dendrogram (or some other way). We prefer to use Wards clustering method and Manhattan distances, as described in the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182019000581). We have also enjoyed using [MicrobeTrace](https://microbetrace.herokuapp.com), which is a great tool for visualization of paired distance tables and matrices, developed by [Tony Boyles](https://github.com/aaboyles).\n\n### Parallelization\nParts of two of these scripts have been parallelized to reduce the time of computation: \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" and \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\". The number of cores used for each of these scripts is currently set to 12 and this setting should be adjusted depending on resources avaible on the users system. The setting can be adjusted for the \"euk_bayesian_fulldataset_V2.r\" script at around line 123. For the \"euk_heuristic_fulldataset.r\" script, this setting can be adjusted at around line 96.\n\n### Notes\nTheoretically, the more specimens from your population included in the analysis, and the more markers analyzed, the more accurate the clustering should be. This is a pop-gen tool and works best when many members of your test population are represented in the dataset. We are currently performing experiments to determine the optimal sample sizes and other factors that impact the acuracy of clustering.\n\n***IMPORTANT: These scripts will not run correctly in R console or R studio. Run them in a terminal window only.***\n\n### License agreement\nThe manuscript describing this method and the scripts provided here have been distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the same Creative Commons licence is included and the original work is properly cited.\n\n### If you make use of these files and find our work helpful, please don't forget to cite us:\n\n```Barratt, JLN, S Park, FS Nascimento, J Hofstetter, M Plucinski, S Casillas, RS Bradbury, MJ Arrowood, Y Qvarnstrom, E Talundzic (2019) Genotyping genetically heterogeneous Cyclospora cayetanensis infections to complement epidemiological case linkage.

Overwrite data or results if they are found to exist.\n\n```bash\n>> poetry run reproduce --parallel --force-fresh-data=True\n```\n\nYou may find intermediate and publication results in `./muss_data/DerivedCrossParticipants/product_run`.\n\n### Sample reproduction results\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/qutang/MUSS/releases/latest/download/sample_reproduction_results.tar.gz) for a sample reproduction results.\n\n### Get help \n\nRun above command at the root of the repository to see the usage of the reproduction script.\n\n```bash\n>> poetry run python reproduce.py --help\n```\n\nThe reproduct script will do the following,\n\n1. Download and unzip the raw dataset\n2. Compute features and convert annotations to class labels\n3. Run LOSO cross validations on datasets of different combinations of sensor placements\n4. Compute metrics from the outputs of the LOSO cross validations\n5. Generate publication tables and graphs \n\n## Train and save a model using muss dataset\n\nMake sure you run the `reproduce` script at first.\n\nYou may want to train and save an activity recognition model using the dataset shipped with this repo.

Observations in two different filters within a short time window (e.g., g-and-i, or r-and-z, within 1.5 hr) are desirable for this purpose. Such an observing strategy delivers both the color and light curve evolution of transients on the same night. This allows the identification and initial characterization of fast transient\u00e2\u0080\u0094or fast features of longer timescale transients\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as rapidly declining supernovae, kilonovae, and the signatures of SN ejecta interacting with binary companion stars or circumstellar material. Some of these extragalactic transients are intrinsically rare and generally all hard to find, thus upcoming surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could dramatically improve our understanding of their origin and properties. We colloquially refer to such a strategy implementation for the LSST as the Presto-Color strategy (rapid-color). This cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimal requirements allow for overall optimization of a survey for other science goals.}\n}\n```\n\nwhich is an extansion of the [original White

Observations in two different filters within a short time window (e.g., g-and-i, or r-and-z, within 1.5 hr) are desirable for this purpose. Such an observing strategy delivers both the color and light curve evolution of transients on the same night. This allows the identification and initial characterization of fast transient\u00e2\u0080\u0094or fast features of longer timescale transients\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as rapidly declining supernovae, kilonovae, and the signatures of SN ejecta interacting with binary companion stars or circumstellar material. Some of these extragalactic transients are intrinsically rare and generally all hard to find, thus upcoming surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could dramatically improve our understanding of their origin and properties. We colloquially refer to such a strategy implementation for the LSST as the Presto-Color strategy (rapid-color). This cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimal requirements allow for overall optimization of a survey for other science goals.}\n}\n```\n\nwhich is an extansion of the [original White Paper](https://www.lsst.org/submitted-whitepaper-2018) submitted in response to the [LSST call for white papers](https://www.lsst.org/call-whitepaper-2018) to propose LSST cadence strategies\n\n\nPlease expect some better comments and some clean-up of this repository, In the mean time: the paper is collected in [paper](paper) while all the code behind the results and figures is in [FastTrWP](FastTrWP)\n"}, "ktm2/ImageDataExtractor": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "ktm2/ImageDataExtractor", "diskUsage": 284, "name": "ImageDataExtractor", "owner": {"login": "ktm2"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Python"}]}, "createdAt": "2019-02-18T14:05:37Z", "pushedAt": "2019-11-28T15:13:55Z", "object": {"text": "# ImageDataExtractor\n\nImageDataExtractor is a toolkit for the automatic extraction of microscopy images. \n\n## Features\n\n- Automatic detection and download of microscopy images from scientific articles \n- HTML and XML document format support\n- High-throughput capabilities\n- Direct extraction from image files \n- PNG, GIF, JPEG, TIFF image format support\n\n## Installation\n\nIt is best to install ImageDataExtractor using `pip`, but it is also possible to directly install from source.

As such, SPD \nmatrices such as the Covariance matrix represent a powerful features for use in such fields as computer vision and \nneuroscience.  In terms of differential geometry, SPD matrices occupy their own Lie group and therefore are characterized\nby an underlying manifold.  The geometry of the underlying manifold is inherently non-Euclidean.  This poses a challenge\nfor for many ML techinques, especially deep neural networks which are optimized in euclidean space.  However, being that\nthe manifold has the characteristics of a Riemannian manifold (with applicable Riemannian metrics), mathematical tools \nexist for interfacing between the two domains.\n \nEigentorch is a simple extension of Pytorch which aims to provide a neural network layer model (SPDNet) for the \nprocessing of features formed by symmetric-positive definite matrices while performing all parameter updates on the \nunderlying Riemannian geometry.  By constraining gradient calculation, and thus weight updates to this underlying \ngeometry, features can therefore be manipulated via forward and backward propagation without distortion of the true \nunderlying feature space.  \n\nThe network described in this project provides mechanisms for the creation (via forward propogation) of new SPD features \n(via multiple filters) while simulataneously reducing matrix rank.  This is intentionally similar to CNN architecture, \nexcept without the need for additional pooling layers.  It also provides a mechanism for eigenvalue based regularization \nensuring that resultant SPD matrices don't approach becoming singular.  Furthermore it provides for projection \n(via a Riemmanian metric), of resultant features from the manifold onto a flattened space which can be discriminated by \nEuclidean methods. This allows for classification of the resultant features in Euclidean space via customary approaches \nsuch as an MLP layer.\n\n__SPDNet is originally described in the following prior work which inspired this project.

A Riemannian Network for SPD Matrix Learning, 2036\u20132042.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2014.132_\n\n### Examples\n* spdnn.ipynb: demonstrates BiMap layer with manifold optimization\n\n### modules\n* __eigenfunctions.py:__ This provides the custom autograd functions necessary to implement the riemannian math\n    * _BiMap_: Uses a bilinear transformation to turn an SPD matrix into another SPD matrix.  This is the only function \n    with parameters.  Parameters are assumed to be points on Stiefel Manifold and the gradients returned are referenced \n    to the corresponding tangent space.  Therefore, a custom optimizer is necessary to project the gradients back down \n    to the manifold.\n    * _ReEig_:  Inspired by ReLu, this performs SPD regularization by thresholding eigenvalues against a minimum value.\n    * _LogEig_:  Performs LogEuclidean metric calculation which projects an SPD matrix into a flattened representation \n    of the underlying manifold.\n     \n* __eigenoptim.py:__ This provides the custom optimizer object which updates weights for the BiMap layer on the \n                    underlying semi-orthogonal Stiefel manifold.\n* __spdnn.py__: This provides the SpdNet Layer to be use in Pytorch networks. Parameters for BiMap are of instance \n                _StiefelParameter_ which is subclassed from _nn.Parameter_.  \n "}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 63, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage":

"languages": ["Python", "Jupyter Notebook"], "readme_text": "# eigentorch\nSymmetric Positive Definite matrices occupy a special place in the realm of machine learning due to their\nability to condense information while preserving spatial information between multiple features.  As such, SPD \nmatrices such as the Covariance matrix represent a powerful features for use in such fields as computer vision and \nneuroscience.  In terms of differential geometry, SPD matrices occupy their own Lie group and therefore are characterized\nby an underlying manifold.  The geometry of the underlying manifold is inherently non-Euclidean.  This poses a challenge\nfor for many ML techinques, especially deep neural networks which are optimized in euclidean space.  However, being that\nthe manifold has the characteristics of a Riemannian manifold (with applicable Riemannian metrics), mathematical tools \nexist for interfacing between the two domains.\n \nEigentorch is a simple extension of Pytorch which aims to provide a neural network layer model (SPDNet) for the \nprocessing of features formed by symmetric-positive definite matrices while performing all parameter updates on the \nunderlying Riemannian geometry.  By constraining gradient calculation, and thus weight updates to this underlying \ngeometry, features can therefore be manipulated via forward and backward propagation without distortion of the true \nunderlying feature space.  \n\nThe network described in this project provides mechanisms for the creation (via forward propogation) of new SPD features \n(via multiple filters) while simulataneously reducing matrix rank.  This is intentionally similar to CNN architecture, \nexcept without the need for additional pooling layers.  It also provides a mechanism for eigenvalue based regularization \nensuring that resultant SPD matrices don't approach becoming singular.  Furthermore it provides for projection \n(via a Riemmanian metric), of resultant features from the manifold onto a flattened space which can be discriminated by \nEuclidean methods. This allows for classification of the resultant features in Euclidean space via customary approaches \nsuch as an MLP layer.\n\n__SPDNet is originally described in the following prior work which inspired this project.  Eigentorch has \nno direct affiliation with the authors:__\n\n_Huang, Z., & Van Gool, L. (2016). A Riemannian Network for SPD Matrix Learning, 2036\u20132042.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2014.132_\n\n### Examples\n* spdnn.ipynb: demonstrates BiMap layer with manifold optimization\n\n### modules\n* __eigenfunctions.py:__ This provides the custom autograd functions necessary to implement the riemannian math\n    * _BiMap_: Uses a bilinear transformation to turn an SPD matrix into another SPD matrix.  This is the only function \n    with parameters.  Parameters are assumed to be points on Stiefel Manifold and the gradients returned are referenced \n    to the corresponding tangent space.  Therefore, a custom optimizer is necessary to project the gradients back down \n    to the manifold.\n    * _ReEig_:  Inspired by ReLu, this performs SPD regularization by thresholding eigenvalues against a minimum value.\n    * _LogEig_:  Performs LogEuclidean metric calculation which projects an SPD matrix into a flattened representation \n    of the underlying manifold.\n     \n* __eigenoptim.py:__ This provides the custom optimizer object which updates weights for the BiMap layer on the \n                    underlying semi-orthogonal Stiefel manifold.\n* __spdnn.py__: This provides the SpdNet Layer to be use in Pytorch networks. Parameters for BiMap are of instance \n                _StiefelParameter_ which is subclassed from _nn.Parameter_.  \n "}, "xyang619/AdmixSim-java": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner":

PaRallel Epigenomics Data Imputation with Cloud-based Tensor Decomposition. 2017. https://doi.org/10.1101/123927.\n\nThis repository contains the code to run PREDICTD, a program to model the epigenome based on the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project data and to impute the results of epigenomics experiments that have not yet been done. A computing environment for running this code is distributed as an Amazon Machine Image, and it is easiest to get the code up and running by following the steps in the tutorial below to start a cluster in Amazon Web Services. This tutorial will demonstrate how to train the model on the Roadmap Consolidated data set used in the paper. The model can also be used to impute data for a new cell type, and there will be another tutorial for that use case coming soon. If you do not want to run the model, but simply want to get the imputed data from the paper, you will be able to download that data in bigwig format from the ENCODE project website soon.\n\n## Installation\n\nPREDICTD is most readily available on Amazon Web Services as part of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) called PREDICTD (ami-e7b5439f).\n\n## Instructions and Tutorials\n\nFor more examples and information about how to run PREDICTD, please see the wiki page of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/tdurham86/PREDICTD/wiki).\n\n## License\n\nPREDICTD is released as an open-source project under the MIT License:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 tdurham86\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

PaRallel Epigenomics Data Imputation with Cloud-based Tensor Decomposition. 2017. https://doi.org/10.1101/123927.\n\nThis repository contains the code to run PREDICTD, a program to model the epigenome based on the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project data and to impute the results of epigenomics experiments that have not yet been done. A computing environment for running this code is distributed as an Amazon Machine Image, and it is easiest to get the code up and running by following the steps in the tutorial below to start a cluster in Amazon Web Services. This tutorial will demonstrate how to train the model on the Roadmap Consolidated data set used in the paper. The model can also be used to impute data for a new cell type, and there will be another tutorial for that use case coming soon. If you do not want to run the model, but simply want to get the imputed data from the paper, you will be able to download that data in bigwig format from the ENCODE project website soon.\n\n## Installation\n\nPREDICTD is most readily available on Amazon Web Services as part of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) called PREDICTD (ami-e7b5439f).\n\n## Instructions and Tutorials\n\nFor more examples and information about how to run PREDICTD, please see the wiki page of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/tdurham86/PREDICTD/wiki).\n\n## License\n\nPREDICTD is released as an open-source project under the MIT License:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 tdurham86\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Its current\ntwo main feature sets focus on a Voronoi-decomposition-based model of two-dimensional monolayers\nand on a two-dimensional dynamical version of the vertex model. CellGPU grew out of DMS'\n\"DelGPU\" and \"VoroGuppy\" projects, and the current class structure still bears some traces of that\n(please see the contributing page of the documentation, which is maintained at\nhttps://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation\nfor information on upcoming code refactoring and new planned features). The paper describing this\ncode in more detail can currently be found on the arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02939), or in print (\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517301832)\n\nInformation on installing the project and contributing to it is contained in the relevant\nmarkdown files in the base directory and in the doc/markdown directory. Documentation of the\ncode is maintained via Doxygen, which can be viewed at the gitlab.io pagea linked to above, or by compiling\nthe doxygen documentation in the \"/doc\" directory\n\nA very rough outline of some of the main classes and the basic operating flow of the primary branches\nof the code can be found [here](@ref basicinfo); this page is a good place to start before diving into\nthe code (Please note that if you are reading this on the Gitlab main page the links will not work...\nvisit the main documentation page at https://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation or compile\nDoxygen documentation locally).\n\nBy default cellGPU includes a few different classes, mostly using the netCDF format, for saving simulation\ndata. For convenience, a few Mathematica scripts demonstrating how to load these files and turn them\ninto simple visualizations are included in the visualizationTools directory -- these should be readily\nportable to matlab, python, etc.\n\n\n## Project information\nHere are some convenient links to a variety of general information about the cellGPU project; all\nof the below can also be accessed from the @ref projectInfo tab (links work on the gitlab.io\ndocumenation website)\n\n[Basic class overview](@ref basicinfo)\n\n[Installation guide](@ref install)\n\n[Sample code

GPU-accelerated algorithms to simulate off-lattice models of cells. Its current\ntwo main feature sets focus on a Voronoi-decomposition-based model of two-dimensional monolayers\nand on a two-dimensional dynamical version of the vertex model. CellGPU grew out of DMS'\n\"DelGPU\" and \"VoroGuppy\" projects, and the current class structure still bears some traces of that\n(please see the contributing page of the documentation, which is maintained at\nhttps://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation\nfor information on upcoming code refactoring and new planned features). The paper describing this\ncode in more detail can currently be found on the arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02939), or in print (\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517301832)\n\nInformation on installing the project and contributing to it is contained in the relevant\nmarkdown files in the base directory and in the doc/markdown directory. Documentation of the\ncode is maintained via Doxygen, which can be viewed at the gitlab.io pagea linked to above, or by compiling\nthe doxygen documentation in the \"/doc\" directory\n\nA very rough outline of some of the main classes and the basic operating flow of the primary branches\nof the code can be found [here](@ref basicinfo); this page is a good place to start before diving into\nthe code (Please note that if you are reading this on the Gitlab main page the links will not work...\nvisit the main documentation page at https://dmsussman.gitlab.io/cellGPUdocumentation or compile\nDoxygen documentation locally).\n\nBy default cellGPU includes a few different classes, mostly using the netCDF format, for saving simulation\ndata. For convenience, a few Mathematica scripts demonstrating how to load these files and turn them\ninto simple visualizations are included in the visualizationTools directory -- these should be readily\nportable to matlab, python, etc.\n\n\n## Project information\nHere are some convenient links to a variety of general information about the cellGPU project; all\nof the below can also be accessed from the @ref projectInfo tab (links work on the gitlab.io\ndocumenation website)\n\n[Basic class overview](@ref basicinfo)\n\n[Installation guide](@ref install)\n\n[Sample code snippets](@ref code)\n\n[Contributing to cellGPU](@ref contrib)\n\n[Citations](@ref cite)\n\n[Open-source information](@ref license)\n\n[cellGPU version information](@ref

DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/134013329.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/134013329)\n\n## Purpose\n\nBuilt by the lab of [Regina Stevens-Truss, PhD](https://reason.kzoo.edu/chem/faculty/regina/) (Professor & Chair, Department of Chemistry, Kalamazoo College), helixvis can be used to create publication-quality, 2-dimensional visualizations of alpha-helical peptide sequences.\nSpecifically, this package allows the user to programmatically generate helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams to provide a bird's eye, top-down view of alpha-helical oligopeptides.\nAlthough other tools exist to complete this task, they generally provide a graphical user interface for manual input of peptide sequences, without allowing for programmatic creation and customization of visualizations.\nProgrammatic generation of helical wheels in open source R provides multiple benefits, including:\n\n* quick and easy incorporation of wheels into Rmarkdown documents\n* rapid generation of many peptides (e.g. all the elements of a peptide database) without manual steps\n* programmatic customization of visualizations using ggplot2\n* reproducibility: practically zero manual steps required for design and creation of helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams\n\n## Installation\n\nhelixvis is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=helixvis).\nThe development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis).\nThe following R code can be used to install and load helixvis.\n\n```r\n# install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"helixvis\")\n\n# install development version from GitHub repository\ndevtools::install_github(\"rrrlw/helixvis\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\n# load for use\nlibrary(\"helixvis\")\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following code demonstrates the use of helixvis to using sample data included in the package (development version only).\n\n\n```r\n# load helixvis\nlibrary(\"helixvis\")\n\n# load sample dataset\ndata(\"sequence\")\n\n# visualize helical wheel from first peptide in sample data\ndraw_wheel(sequence$Seq[1])\n\n# save to workspace\nggplot2::ggsave(paste(sequence$Name[1], \".png\", sep = \"\"),\n                width = 6, height = 6)\n\n# visualize wenxiang diagram from second peptide in sample data\ndraw_wenxiang(sequence$Seq[2])\n\n# save to workspace\nggplot2::ggsave(paste(sequence$Name[2], \".png\", sep = \"\"),\n                width = 6, height = 6)\n```\n\n## Contributions\n\nPlease report any bugs, suggestions, etc. on the [issues page](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis/issues) of the [helixvis GitHub repository](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis).\nContributions (bug fixes, new features, etc.) are welcome via pull requests (generally from forked repositories).\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 142, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor":

DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/134013329.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/134013329)\n\n## Purpose\n\nBuilt by the lab of [Regina Stevens-Truss, PhD](https://reason.kzoo.edu/chem/faculty/regina/) (Professor & Chair, Department of Chemistry, Kalamazoo College), helixvis can be used to create publication-quality, 2-dimensional visualizations of alpha-helical peptide sequences.\nSpecifically, this package allows the user to programmatically generate helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams to provide a bird's eye, top-down view of alpha-helical oligopeptides.\nAlthough other tools exist to complete this task, they generally provide a graphical user interface for manual input of peptide sequences, without allowing for programmatic creation and customization of visualizations.\nProgrammatic generation of helical wheels in open source R provides multiple benefits, including:\n\n* quick and easy incorporation of wheels into Rmarkdown documents\n* rapid generation of many peptides (e.g. all the elements of a peptide database) without manual steps\n* programmatic customization of visualizations using ggplot2\n* reproducibility: practically zero manual steps required for design and creation of helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams\n\n## Installation\n\nhelixvis is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=helixvis).\nThe development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis).\nThe following R code can be used to install and load helixvis.\n\n```r\n# install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"helixvis\")\n\n# install development version from GitHub repository\ndevtools::install_github(\"rrrlw/helixvis\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\n# load for use\nlibrary(\"helixvis\")\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following code demonstrates the use of helixvis to using sample data included in the package (development version only).\n\n\n```r\n# load helixvis\nlibrary(\"helixvis\")\n\n# load sample dataset\ndata(\"sequence\")\n\n# visualize helical wheel from first peptide in sample data\ndraw_wheel(sequence$Seq[1])\n\n# save to workspace\nggplot2::ggsave(paste(sequence$Name[1], \".png\", sep = \"\"),\n                width = 6, height = 6)\n\n# visualize wenxiang diagram from second peptide in sample data\ndraw_wenxiang(sequence$Seq[2])\n\n# save to workspace\nggplot2::ggsave(paste(sequence$Name[2], \".png\", sep = \"\"),\n                width = 6, height = 6)\n```\n\n## Contributions\n\nPlease report any bugs, suggestions, etc. on the [issues page](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis/issues) of the [helixvis GitHub repository](https://github.com/rrrlw/helixvis).\nContributions (bug fixes, new features, etc.) are welcome via pull requests (generally from forked repositories).\n"}, "flaviovdf/tag_assess": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "flaviovdf/tag_assess", "diskUsage": 2092, "name":

This is a package for tidy *t*-tests.\n  - Finally, use devtools to dowload the **OSFR** package from GitHub. This is a package to import the dataset from OSF.io.\n- No data is shared on GitHub; you will need to add the file `sync-async-dataset.csv` manually to this repository OR follow the instructions to import the file from OSF.io.\n  - The data is \"ignored\" by the `.gitignore` file; you can double-check that yours ignores these files, too, in the case that you push changes, but it should copy over

and Estimating Its Effect via a Bayesian Mendelian Randomization Approach\" by Ioan Gabriel Bucur, Tom Claassen, and Tom Heskes, which has been published in Statistical Methods in Medical Research (https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280219851817).\n\n## Prerequisites\n- This software uses the *Armadillo* C++ library for linear algebra and scientific computing. To install Armadillo on your machine, please follow the instructions at http://arma.sourceforge.net/ .\n- This software uses the *Boost* Math Toolkit for the statistical distributions and functions. To install Boost on your machine, please follow the instructions at https://www.boost.org/ .\n\n## PolyChord\nThe BayesMR approach uses the *PolyChord* software (Copyright \u00a9 2015 Will Handley, Mike Hobson & Anthony Lasenby) forked from the GitHub repository https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite. The license agreement can be found at https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite/blob/master/LICENCE or within the PolyChordLite submodule included in this repository.\n\n\n## Installation instructions\n1. Clone this repository using the --recurse-submodules option, e.g.:\n`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/igbucur/BayesMR.git`.\n\n2. Enter the folder where the repository was cloned (called BayesMR by default) and execute the Makefile using: `make polychord_MR`. Assuming everything managed to compile successfully, the PolyChord implementation of the BayesMR approach should appear as the executable file _BayesMR/bin/polychord_MR_.\n\n3. Execute the script `./run_SMMR_experiments.sh` provided with the package to verify that the installation is working.\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 55, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage":

Approach\" by Ioan Gabriel Bucur, Tom Claassen, and Tom Heskes, which has been published in Statistical Methods in Medical Research (https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280219851817).\n\n## Prerequisites\n- This software uses the *Armadillo* C++ library for linear algebra and scientific computing. To install Armadillo on your machine, please follow the instructions at http://arma.sourceforge.net/ .\n- This software uses the *Boost* Math Toolkit for the statistical distributions and functions. To install Boost on your machine, please follow the instructions at https://www.boost.org/ .\n\n## PolyChord\nThe BayesMR approach uses the *PolyChord* software (Copyright \u00a9 2015 Will Handley, Mike Hobson & Anthony Lasenby) forked from the GitHub repository https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite. The license agreement can be found at https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite/blob/master/LICENCE or within the PolyChordLite submodule included in this repository.\n\n\n## Installation instructions\n1. Clone this repository using the --recurse-submodules option, e.g.:\n`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/igbucur/BayesMR.git`.\n\n2. Enter the folder where the repository was cloned (called BayesMR by default) and execute the Makefile using: `make polychord_MR`. Assuming everything managed to compile successfully, the PolyChord implementation of the BayesMR approach should appear as the executable file _BayesMR/bin/polychord_MR_.\n\n3. Execute the script `./run_SMMR_experiments.sh` provided with the package to verify that the installation is working.\n"}, "jgarridoalcazar/InhPlastVisualization": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "jgarridoalcazar/InhPlastVisualization", "diskUsage": 190235, "name": "InhPlastVisualization", "owner": {"login": "jgarridoalcazar"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Jupyter Notebook"}, {"name": "Python"}, {"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "CMake"}, {"name": "C++"}]}, "createdAt": "2020-02-20T11:31:03Z", "pushedAt": "2020-04-21T16:32:25Z", "object": {"text": "# InhPlastVisualization\nSimulations for Inhibitory Plasticity visualization tools. \n\nThis code corresponds to the paper: \nSimulation, visualization and analysis tools for pattern recognition assessment with spiking neuronal networks\nby Sergio E.

Assessing the potential for competition between Pacific Halibut (<i>Hippoglossus stenolepis</i>) and Arrowtooth Flounder (<i>Atheresthes stomias</i>) in the Gulf of Alaska. PLoS ONE. 13(12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209402\n\n# Overview\nThese files detail analyses used to estimate the degree of resource partitioning (as a proxy for the potential for competition) between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder (30 to 69 cm fork length) in the Gulf of Alaska. \n\n# Data Sources\nWe used standardized survey data procured from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association [NOAA]). All necessary data can be found in the 'Data' folder of this repository. See von Szalay and Raring (2016) and Livingston et al. (2017) for data collection methods.\n\nBottom trawl survey data (1990 to 2017) were collected by the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division and are publicly accessible here: https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/data.htm.\n\nFood habits data (1990 to 2013) were provided by the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling (REEM) Program and are publicly accessible here: https://access.afsc.noaa.gov/REEM/WebDietData/DietDataIntro.php. \n\n# Spatial Overlap\nThe 'SpatialAnalyses' script file includes the code necessary to construct a delta model for estimating spatial overlap between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder in the Gulf of Alaska. Methods were modified from Hunsicker et al. (2013) and Shelton et al. (2017).\n\nWe used generalized additive models to quantify and predict the probability of occurrence and relative abundance of Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder across a uniform grid spanning the study area. We multiplied probabilities of occurrence and relative abundances to estimate overall abundance in each survey year-grid cell combination. We then multiplied standardized abundances of each species to estimate spatial overlap in each combination of survey year and grid cell. \n\n# Dietary Overlap\nThe 'DietaryAnalyses' script file includes the code necessary to calculate species-specific proportions of prey by weight in each survey year and grid cell. We used proportions of prey by weight to calculate Schoener's index of dietary overlap.\n\n# Resource Partitioning\nThe 'ResourcePartitioningAnalyses' script file combines spatial overlap and dietary overlap to quantify the correlation between the two measures and thus the degree of resource partitioning between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder in the Gulf of Alaska. Descriptions of resource partitioning can be found in Schoener (1974) and Ross (1986).\n\n# Acknowledgments\nWayne Palsson and Kirstin Holsman queried and provided guidance regarding the use of AFSC databases.

PLoS ONE. 13(12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209402\n\n# Overview\nThese files detail analyses used to estimate the degree of resource partitioning (as a proxy for the potential for competition) between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder (30 to 69 cm fork length) in the Gulf of Alaska. \n\n# Data Sources\nWe used standardized survey data procured from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association [NOAA]).

(2017) for data collection methods.\n\nBottom trawl survey data (1990 to 2017) were collected by the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division and are publicly accessible here: https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/data.htm.\n\nFood habits data (1990 to 2013) were provided by the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling (REEM) Program and are publicly accessible here: https://access.afsc.noaa.gov/REEM/WebDietData/DietDataIntro.php. \n\n# Spatial Overlap\nThe 'SpatialAnalyses' script file includes the code necessary to construct a delta model for estimating spatial overlap between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder in the Gulf of Alaska. Methods were modified from Hunsicker et al. (2013) and Shelton et al. (2017).\n\nWe used generalized additive models to quantify and predict the probability of occurrence and relative abundance of Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder across a uniform grid spanning the study area. We multiplied probabilities of occurrence and relative abundances to estimate overall abundance in each survey year-grid cell combination. We then multiplied standardized abundances of each species to estimate spatial overlap in each combination of survey year and grid cell. \n\n# Dietary Overlap\nThe 'DietaryAnalyses' script file includes the code necessary to calculate species-specific proportions of prey by weight in each survey year and grid cell. We used proportions of prey by weight to calculate Schoener's index of dietary overlap.\n\n# Resource Partitioning\nThe 'ResourcePartitioningAnalyses' script file combines spatial overlap and dietary overlap to quantify the correlation between the two measures and thus the degree of resource partitioning between Pacific Halibut and Arrowtooth Flounder in the Gulf of Alaska. Descriptions of resource partitioning can be found in Schoener (1974) and Ross (1986).\n\n# Acknowledgments\nWayne Palsson and Kirstin Holsman queried and provided guidance regarding the use of AFSC databases.

Configuration of tailseeker run is provided in the tailseeker.yaml file which can be found in the flowcell1/flowcell2 folders. Before running the tailseeker modify the file to provide the proper path to flowcell data (dir variable). Tailseeker will generate R5 and R3 files, which are deduplicated (based on UMI sequences), and provide information about lengths of A-tails (and possible additions at the end of a tail). Tailseeker is run using command:\n\n  ```\n   tseek -j\n  ```\n\n2. **Demultiplexing (only for Seq2-5)**\n\n    Demultiplexing is done using [sabre](https://github.com/najoshi/sabre). The code of sabre was modified to include primer sequences in the output (apropriate [pull request](https://github.com/najoshi/sabre/pull/8) sent to the sabre developer).\n\n    Script prepared for this purpose require the barcode files used for demultiplex (which can be found in `flowcell2/sabre_barcodes`) are located in the same folder as fastq files which will be demultiplexed (folder `fastq` in the output of tailseeker).\n\n    To perform demultiplexing copy `demultiplex_sabre.sh` to the `fastq` folder and run:\n\n  ```\n   ./demultiplex_sabre.sh\n  ```\n\n3. **LINE1 sequences identification**\n\n    To identify LINE1 sequences in demultiplexed reads [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/) is used.\n\n    Fastq sequences are first converted to fasta using `fastq_to_fasta` from fastx_toolkit. Then, RepeatMasker is run over the LINE1-specific database. Obtained hits are parsed using `parseRM_simple.pl` from [Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs](https://github.com/4ureliek/Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs) and analyzed using `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip.py` to get information about location of LINE1 in the sequencing reads and about non-templated nucleotides (possible tails).\n\n    Scripts `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip.py` and `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip_R3.py` must be copied to the `processing_out_sabre` folder. `repeatmasker.sh` should be run in the same folder.\n\n  ```\n   ./repeatmasker.sh\n  ```\n\n    This part of analysis can be time-consuming.\n\n4. **Tails analysis**\n\n    In the next step the actual analysis is done. For the LINE1 sequences the information about non-templated nucleotides (possible tails) is already obtained. For other sequences (GAPDH, reporter LINE1) it is retrieved by mapping using `bowtie2` with `--very-sensitive-local` option to get soft-clipping. Soft-clipped fragments are then retrieved using `get_softclipped_reads_from_sam.pl` script.\n\n    Analysis is run on the all files with names ending with `_R5.fastq` in the folder specified with the `--inputdir` option. More specific selection can be done with the `--glob` option of the analysis script.\n\n    For the all analyzed files a samplesheet is required, which contains all information regarding the samples, including experimental conditions, primer used, transcript, etc. This file must be prepared before the analysis. Example is located in the `flowcell2` folder (`samplesheet.csv`). Default path to the samplesheet is provided in the script, but the alternative one can be provided with the `--samplesheet` option.\n\n    Script performs also calculation of the terminal nucleotides composition (used for the generation of sequence logos). To change the default sequence window used for calculation (7 nt) one can use the `--window` option\n\n    As the output (specified with the `--output` option) a tsv file is generated, containing tailing information for each sequence analysed, as well as additional data regarding the procedure.\n\n    Before running the script it is required to customize settings (at the beginning of the script), like the path to `bowtie2`, number of threads it can use, names and locations of bowtie2 indexes.\n\n    Analysis for the flowcell2 can be run using:\n\n  ```\n   ./analyze_race_seq.py --inputdir processing_out_sabre/ --output flowcell2_output.tsv\n  ```\n\n5. **Statistical analysis, plots**\n\n  Further analysis is done using provided R scripts. Computations may require around 20GB or RAM memory. Functions used to import and filter data and calculate various parameters (mostly the uridylation level) are located in the `R/raceseq.R` file\n  \n  Note that for the LINE-1 reporter overexpression experiments, reads should be filtered and include only those, which end in the LINE-1 3'-UTR (mapping_position_max = 9010), to exclude plasmid-borne and artifically elongated reads. \n\n## How to get LINE-specific repeatmasker library\n\nFor the identification of LINE1 sequences we used RepeatMasker run with the library containing only human LINE1 sequences. It can be easily prepared using scripts available in the RepeatMasker distribution and HMMER. The detailed procedure is shown below:\n\n- in the `util` subfolder in the RepeatMasker base directory run\n\n  ```\n    ./queryRepeatDatabase.pl -class \"LINE\" -species \"Homo sapiens\" > LINE_sequences.fasta\n  ```\n\n- extract LINEs names:\n\n  ```\n  cat LINE_sequences.fasta | grep \"^>\"  | cut -d' ' -f1 | sed -r 's/>(.*)/\\1/' > LINE_names.txt\n  ```\n\n- extract hmms for LINEs from homo sapiens LINEs library (located in `Libraries/Dfam_2.0/homo_sapiens/`) using hmmfetch\n\n  ```\n    hmmfetch -f masklib.hmm lines_names.txt > LINEs.hmm\n  ```\n\n- press obtained hmm database\n\n  ```\n    hmmpress LINEs.hmm\n  ```\n\n- use this database in repeatmasker by specifying the exact path with the -d option\n"}, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 73,

data\n- if required - perform additional demultiplexing based on primer sequences (we used modified [sabre](https://github.com/najoshi/sabre) for this purpose, available as a fork at <https://github.com/smaegol/sabre>)\n- create samplesheet describing files to be analyzed, and they important features\n- for LINE sequences (or other repetitive elements) identification run repeatmasker using `repeatmasker.sh` script (may take a long time)\n- run `analyze_race_seq.py` script to get tails analysis done\n- perform additional analyzes in R using attached scripts\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [tailseeker](https://github.com/hyeshik/tailseeker)\n- [repeatmasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/) with the [repbase libraries](http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/index.php) downloaded and installed\n- [Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs](https://github.com/4ureliek/Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs) scripts downloaded\n- [fastx toolkit](http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)\n- [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)\n- Python 3\n- Python libraries installed:\n\n  - biopython\n  - pandas\n  - numpy\n  - subprocess\n\n- Perl libraries installed:\n\n  - bioperl\n  - Getopt\n  - Term::ProgressBar\n\n- R together with:\n\n  - ggplot2\n  - plyr\n  - dplyr\n  - [ggseqlogo](https://github.com/omarwagih/ggseqlogo)\n\n## Detailed procedure\n\n1. **Basecalling, deduplication, identification of A-tails**\n\n    This step is done using [tailseeker software](https://github.com/hyeshik/tailseeker). Configuration of tailseeker run is provided in the tailseeker.yaml file which can be found in the flowcell1/flowcell2 folders. Before running the tailseeker modify the file to provide the proper path to flowcell data (dir variable). Tailseeker will generate R5 and R3 files, which are deduplicated (based on UMI sequences), and provide information about lengths of A-tails (and possible additions at the end of a tail). Tailseeker is run using command:\n\n  ```\n   tseek -j\n  ```\n\n2. **Demultiplexing (only for Seq2-5)**\n\n    Demultiplexing is done using [sabre](https://github.com/najoshi/sabre). The code of sabre was modified to include primer sequences in the output (apropriate [pull request](https://github.com/najoshi/sabre/pull/8) sent to the sabre developer).\n\n    Script prepared for this purpose require the barcode files used for demultiplex (which can be found in `flowcell2/sabre_barcodes`) are located in the same folder as fastq files which will be demultiplexed (folder `fastq` in the output of tailseeker).\n\n    To perform demultiplexing copy `demultiplex_sabre.sh` to the `fastq` folder and run:\n\n  ```\n   ./demultiplex_sabre.sh\n  ```\n\n3. **LINE1 sequences identification**\n\n    To identify LINE1 sequences in demultiplexed reads [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/) is used.\n\n    Fastq sequences are first converted to fasta using `fastq_to_fasta` from fastx_toolkit. Then, RepeatMasker is run over the LINE1-specific database. Obtained hits are parsed using `parseRM_simple.pl` from [Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs](https://github.com/4ureliek/Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs) and analyzed using `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip.py` to get information about location of LINE1 in the sequencing reads and about non-templated nucleotides (possible tails).\n\n    Scripts `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip.py` and `identify_LINE_repeatmasker_softclip_R3.py` must be copied to the `processing_out_sabre` folder. `repeatmasker.sh` should be run in the same folder.\n\n  ```\n   ./repeatmasker.sh\n  ```\n\n    This part of analysis can be time-consuming.\n\n4. **Tails analysis**\n\n    In the next step the actual analysis is done. For the LINE1 sequences the information about non-templated nucleotides (possible tails) is already obtained. For other sequences (GAPDH, reporter LINE1) it is retrieved by mapping using `bowtie2` with `--very-sensitive-local` option to get soft-clipping. Soft-clipped fragments are then retrieved using `get_softclipped_reads_from_sam.pl` script.\n\n    Analysis is run on the all files with names ending with `_R5.fastq` in the folder specified with the `--inputdir` option. More specific selection can be done with the `--glob` option of the analysis script.\n\n    For the all analyzed files a samplesheet is required, which contains all information regarding the samples, including experimental conditions, primer used, transcript, etc. This file must be prepared before the analysis. Example is located in the `flowcell2` folder (`samplesheet.csv`). Default path to the samplesheet is provided in the script, but the alternative one can be provided with the `--samplesheet` option.\n\n    Script performs also calculation of the terminal nucleotides composition (used for the generation of sequence logos). To change the default sequence window used for calculation (7 nt) one can use the `--window` option\n\n    As the output (specified with the `--output` option) a tsv file is generated, containing tailing information for each sequence analysed, as well as additional data regarding the procedure.\n\n    Before running the script it is required to customize settings (at the beginning of the script), like the path to `bowtie2`, number of threads it can use, names and locations of bowtie2 indexes.\n\n    Analysis for the flowcell2 can be run using:\n\n  ```\n   ./analyze_race_seq.py --inputdir processing_out_sabre/ --output flowcell2_output.tsv\n  ```\n\n5. **Statistical analysis, plots**\n\n  Further analysis is done using provided R scripts. Computations may require around 20GB or RAM memory. Functions used to import and filter data and calculate various parameters (mostly the uridylation level) are located in the `R/raceseq.R` file\n  \n  Note that for the LINE-1 reporter overexpression experiments, reads should be filtered and include only those, which end in the LINE-1 3'-UTR (mapping_position_max = 9010), to exclude plasmid-borne and artifically elongated reads. \n\n## How to get LINE-specific repeatmasker library\n\nFor the identification of LINE1 sequences we used RepeatMasker run with the library containing only human LINE1 sequences. It can be easily prepared using scripts available in the RepeatMasker distribution and HMMER. The detailed procedure is shown below:\n\n- in the `util` subfolder in the RepeatMasker base directory run\n\n  ```\n    ./queryRepeatDatabase.pl -class \"LINE\" -species \"Homo sapiens\" > LINE_sequences.fasta\n  ```\n\n- extract LINEs names:\n\n  ```\n  cat LINE_sequences.fasta | grep \"^>\"  | cut -d' ' -f1 | sed -r 's/>(.*)/\\1/' > LINE_names.txt\n  ```\n\n- extract hmms for LINEs from homo sapiens LINEs library (located in `Libraries/Dfam_2.0/homo_sapiens/`) using hmmfetch\n\n  ```\n    hmmfetch -f masklib.hmm lines_names.txt > LINEs.hmm\n  ```\n\n- press obtained hmm database\n\n  ```\n    hmmpress LINEs.hmm\n  ```\n\n- use this database in repeatmasker by specifying the exact path with the -d option\n"}, "barberislab/GEMMER": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "barberislab/GEMMER", "diskUsage": 13705, "name": "GEMMER", "owner": {"login": "barberislab"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "Perl"}, {"name": "Python"}, {"name": "PHP"}, {"name": "HTML"}, {"name": "JavaScript"}, {"name": "CSS"}, {"name": "Shell"}, {"name": "Hack"}]}, "createdAt": "2017-03-02T22:47:10Z", "pushedAt": "2019-08-06T20:24:19Z", "object": {"text": "# GEMMER\n![Logo](img/GEMMER_logo.png)\n\n## About GEMMER\n### Motivation\nMulti-scale modeling of biological systems requires integration of various information about genes and proteins that are connected together in networks.

GEMMER\n![Logo](img/GEMMER_logo.png)\n\n## About GEMMER\n### Motivation\nMulti-scale modeling of biological systems requires integration of various information about genes and proteins that are connected together in networks. Spatial, temporal and functional information is available; however, it is still a challenge to retrieve and explore this knowledge in an integrated, quick and user-friendly manner.\n\n### Results\nWe present GEMMER (GEnome-wide tool for Multi-scale Modeling data Extraction and Representation), a web-based data-integration tool that facilitates high quality visualization of physical, regulatory and genetic interactions between proteins/genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GEMMER creates network visualizations that integrate information on function, temporal expression, localization and abundance from various existing databases. GEMMER supports modeling efforts by effortlessly gathering this information and providing convenient export options for images and their underlying data.\n\n### Availability and implementation\nGEMMER is freely available at http://gemmer.barberislab.com. Source code, written in Python, JavaScript library D3js, PHP and JSON, is freely available at https://github.com/barberislab/GEMMER.\n\n## Publication\nWe are pleased to announce that GEMMER has been accepted for publication in Bioinformatics. You can find the publication [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty052).\n\n## Workflow\n![Workflow](img/GEMMER_workflow.png)\n"}, "Sage-Bionetworks/sss": {"rep_data": {"nameWithOwner": "Sage-Bionetworks/sss", "diskUsage": 3316, "name": "sss", "owner": {"login": "Sage-Bionetworks"}, "languages": {"nodes": [{"name": "JavaScript"}, {"name": "R"}]}, "createdAt": "2012-02-16T05:10:23Z", "pushedAt": "2012-09-21T17:31:27Z", "object": null, "ref": {"target": {"history": {"totalCount": 62, "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": true, "commitsEndCursor": "7ca02db223c9f57e0a2bba72110374d067ed3db9 24"}, "edges": [{"node": {"additions": 1, "author": {"name": "Brian Bot", "email": "brian.bot@sagebase.org", "date": "2012-09-21T10:30:48-07:00"}, "pushedDate": "2012-09-21T17:31:28Z", "messageHeadline": "updated switch for running windows binary x64", "message": "updated switch for running windows binary x64"}}, {"node": {"additions": 3, "author": {"name": "Erich S.

Usage\n-----------\n+ See the doc strings in `seagen.py` for all the details.\n+ Create a single shell of particles and print their positions:\n    ```python\n    import seagen\n    N = 100\n    r = 1\n\n    particles = seagen.GenShell(N, r)\n\n    print(particles.x, particles.y, particles.z)\n    ```\n+ Create a full sphere of particles on a simple density profile and print their\n    positions and masses:\n    ```python\n    import seagen\n    import numpy as np\n    N = 100000\n    radii = np.arange(0.01, 10, 0.01)\n    densities = np.ones(len(radii))     # e.g. constant density\n\n    particles = seagen.GenSphere(N, radii, densities)\n\n    print(particles.x, particles.y, particles.z, particles.m)\n    ```\n+ See `examples.py` for other working examples, e.g. an arbitrary density\n    profile with multiple layers and extra temperature information.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n+ `PyPI`: Automatically install the package with `pip install seagen`, see\n    https://pypi.org/project/seagen/\n+ Direct download: The single `seagen.py` file can be imported and used without\n    any extra installation, so you can just download this repository and place\n    the file in a local directory or wherever your python will look for modules.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n+ Python 3 (tested with 3.6.0).\n\n\nNotation etc.\n-------------\n+ PEP8 is followed in most cases apart from some indentation alignment.\n+ Arrays are explicitly labelled with a prefix `A1_`, or `An_` for an\n    `n`-dimensional array.\n+ Particle is abbreviated to `picle`.\n"}, "ref":

We will try to keep this server up and running. In case it is down anyway, below are several options to rebuild the server yourself.\n\n# Docker version\nThis repo contains the materials to start your own copy of the above server using docker. It is started by simply running \n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n``` \nusing the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file contained in this repo. \n\nProvided that you have docker and docker-compose set up on your machine, just running the above command should pull the [images from docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vre4eic/) and start the webserver at your own computer. To test, just point your web browser to http://localhost:3052/gender/p/tables_and_figures_from_paper.swinb\n\n# Virtual machine image version\nA virtual machine image is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1237673. It is archived as an Open Virtual Appliance (.ova file) that is packaging the vmdk disk image with an Open Virtual Machine Format (ovf) metadata descriptor. The image is based on a standard Ubuntu 17.04 iso image, with checked-out versions of all relevant source code and data (see below) and installed version of the docker images (see above).\n\nOn bootup, the docker images running in the guest will start a web server that is available from the host at 127.0.0.1:3052/gender/p/tables_and_figures_from_paper.swinb.\n\nThe virtual machine can be accessed using the user name \"vre\" with password \"vrevre\".\n\n# Soure code version\nThe repo contains git submodules linking to other git repositories with source code of other projects used in the paper, run\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\nto populated all source code submodules. \n\nThe repos to rebuild the docker images used in the docker version are also included.\n\n# Data used\nThe paper uses data from three RDF named graphs, stored in gzipped turtle file format. These files are included in the vre4eic/gender-demo-data docker image in the /data/toe directory and have the associated md5sum values: \n```\n070ca73229931c9d0dd4cc1e4648ed75  Events_and_structure.ttl.gz\n3ab7d22806fca083de6b4fd748392913  MembersOfParliament_background.ttl.gz\n8717380919675bf732941f3aa03e3fcd  mep_wikidata.ttl.gz\n```\n\nThese file are also in the gender-demo-data git submodule, as part of the ./gender-demo-data/toe.tgz gzipped tar file.\n\nAll three named graphs have been downloaded from the Talk of Europe project website, see http://www.talkofeurope.eu/ and http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl/\n\nIf you use this data, please cite the corresponding open access paper:\n\nAstrid van Aggelen, Laura Hollink, Max Kemman, Martijn Kleppe, Henri Beunders.

materials to reproduce all figures, tables and other data analysis results reported in our Web Science 2018 paper: \n\nHollink, Laura, Astrid van Aggelen, and Jacco van Ossenbruggen. \n[Using the Web of Data to Study Gender Differences in Online Knowledge Sources: the Case of the European Parliament](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/27616). \nACM Conference on Web Science, May 2018, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. \n[doi:10.1145/3201064.3201108](https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201108)\n\nA copy for long time archival of the repo has been uploaded to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1232929.\n\nA [H2020 \"FAIR\" data management plan](data-management-plan.md) is included.\n\n# Online version\nThe simplest way to rerun the code for the paper is to ignore this repo and just point your browser to https://vre4eic.project.cwi.nl/gender/p/tables_and_figures_from_paper.swinb\n\nThis public swish web server contains all code in an executable notebook style interface. We will try to keep this server up and running. In case it is down anyway, below are several options to rebuild the server yourself.\n\n# Docker version\nThis repo contains the materials to start your own copy of the above server using docker. It is started by simply running \n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n``` \nusing the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file contained in this repo. \n\nProvided that you have docker and docker-compose set up on your machine, just running the above command should pull the [images from docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vre4eic/) and start the webserver at your own computer. To test, just point your web browser to http://localhost:3052/gender/p/tables_and_figures_from_paper.swinb\n\n# Virtual machine image version\nA virtual machine image is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1237673. It is archived as an Open Virtual Appliance (.ova file) that is packaging the vmdk disk image with an Open Virtual Machine Format (ovf) metadata descriptor. The image is based on a standard Ubuntu 17.04 iso image, with checked-out versions of all relevant source code and data (see below) and installed version of the docker images (see above).\n\nOn bootup, the docker images running in the guest will start a web server that is available from the host at 127.0.0.1:3052/gender/p/tables_and_figures_from_paper.swinb.\n\nThe virtual machine can be accessed using the user name \"vre\" with password \"vrevre\".\n\n# Soure code version\nThe repo contains git submodules linking to other git repositories with source code of other projects used in the paper, run\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\nto populated all source code submodules. \n\nThe repos to rebuild the docker images used in the docker version are also included.\n\n# Data used\nThe paper uses data from three RDF named graphs, stored in gzipped turtle file format.

model of linear theory of electromigration published in [Generalized model of the linear theory of electromigration and its application to electrokinetic chromatography: Theory and software PeakMaster 6\u2014Next Generation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/elps.201800400) ([DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201800400](https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201800400)). The model includes both acidobazic and complexation equilibria and is suitable for simulations of capillary zone electrophoresis experimental setups. LEMNG is built on top of [ECHMETCoreLibs](https://github.com/echmet/ECHMETCoreLibs) and uses its facilities to calculate equilibrium composition of solutions. LEMNG consists of a single library that can calculate mobilities, composition and shapes of all eigenzones for a system of given analytical composition and physical-chemical parameters. It can plot the expected electrophoregrams using HVL-R function profiles as well. In terms of complex-forming equilibria, LEMNG is constrained by the same limitations as ECHMETCoreLibs. Please refer to ECHMETCoreLibs documentation for further details.\n\nBuilding\n---\nLEMNG requires the following tools to be built:\n\n- C++14-aware compiler\n- [Eigen matrix library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)\n- [CMake build system](http://cmake.org)\n- [ECHMETCoreLibs](https://github.com/echmet/ECHMETCoreLibs)\n\n### Generate makefiles with CMake\n- Linux\n1. `cd` into the source directory\n2. Run `mkdir build` and `cd build`\n3. Run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=<path_to_eigen_library> -DECHMET_CORE_LIBS_DIR=<path_to_ECHMETCoreLibs_installation>`\n4. Run `make` and `make install`\n- Windows\n1. You may use the CMake GUI tool the set up the required configuration options as it is described in the Linux section\n2. Generate the appropriate project files. MSVC2015 is currently the recommended compiler on Windows although MinGW may be used as well.\n\nExamples\n---\nThere is a reference implementation available in `ref_tool/ref_tool.cpp`. To simplify the building process there is a series of shell scripts available. In order to build the reference tool, set the required paths accordingly to your setup in `ref_tool_glob.sh` and run `build_ref_tool.sh`. Project for MSVC is not available at the moment.\n\nLicensing\n---\nThe LEMNG project is distributed under the terms of **The GNU General Public License v3** (GNU GPLv3). See the enclosed `LICENSE` file for details.\n\nAs permitted by section 7. *Additional Terms* of The GNU GPLv3 license, the authors require that any derivative work based on LEMNG clearly refers to the origin of the software and its authors. Such reference must include the address of this source code repository (https://github.com/echmet/LEMNG) and names of all authors and their affiliation stated in section [Authors](#Authors) of this README file.\n\nReferenceable releases\n---\n- LEMNG 0.6.0 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/113085202.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/113085202)\n\n<a

"LEMNG\n===\n\nIntroduction\n---\nLEMNG (**L**inear **E**lectromigration **M**odel **N**ext **G**eneration) is a computer implementation of a mathematical model of linear theory of electromigration published in [Generalized model of the linear theory of electromigration and its application to electrokinetic chromatography: Theory and software PeakMaster 6\u2014Next Generation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/elps.201800400) ([DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201800400](https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201800400)). The model includes both acidobazic and complexation equilibria and is suitable for simulations of capillary zone electrophoresis experimental setups. LEMNG is built on top of [ECHMETCoreLibs](https://github.com/echmet/ECHMETCoreLibs) and uses its facilities to calculate equilibrium composition of solutions. LEMNG consists of a single library that can calculate mobilities, composition and shapes of all eigenzones for a system of given analytical composition and physical-chemical parameters. It can plot the expected electrophoregrams using HVL-R function profiles as well. In terms of complex-forming equilibria, LEMNG is constrained by the same limitations as ECHMETCoreLibs. Please refer to ECHMETCoreLibs documentation for further details.\n\nBuilding\n---\nLEMNG requires the following tools to be built:\n\n- C++14-aware compiler\n- [Eigen matrix library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)\n- [CMake build system](http://cmake.org)\n- [ECHMETCoreLibs](https://github.com/echmet/ECHMETCoreLibs)\n\n### Generate makefiles with CMake\n- Linux\n1. `cd` into the source directory\n2. Run `mkdir build` and `cd build`\n3. Run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=<path_to_eigen_library> -DECHMET_CORE_LIBS_DIR=<path_to_ECHMETCoreLibs_installation>`\n4. Run `make` and `make install`\n- Windows\n1. You may use the CMake GUI tool the set up the required configuration options as it is described in the Linux section\n2. Generate the appropriate project files. MSVC2015 is currently the recommended compiler on Windows although MinGW may be used as well.\n\nExamples\n---\nThere is a reference implementation available in `ref_tool/ref_tool.cpp`. To simplify the building process there is a series of shell scripts available. In order to build the reference tool, set the required paths accordingly to your setup in `ref_tool_glob.sh` and run `build_ref_tool.sh`.
