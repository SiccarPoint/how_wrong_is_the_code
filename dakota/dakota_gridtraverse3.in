# Dakota input file, uses a moving average approach with a finer scale,
# combined with a second calibration term based on the std of bug find
# rates when at low commits (when there is much scatter, and we know N0
# controls this scatter), i.e., the first exploits the shape and the
# second exploits the distribution of the response.
